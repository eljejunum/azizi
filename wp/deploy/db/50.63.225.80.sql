From a discussion between myself and <a href="http://mikelittle.org/">Mike Little</a> about <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It&#8217;s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won&#8217;t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it&#8217;s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn&#8217;t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href="http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; &#8220;b2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.&#8221; b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren&#8217;t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress&#8217; developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href="http://ryan.boren.me/">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site&#8217;s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href="http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress &#8212; a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we&#8217;ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href="http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it&#8217;s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn&#8217;t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about developers. WordPress&#8217; strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our &#8220;famous 5 minute install&#8221;. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn&#8217;t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn&#8217;t write code, it didn&#8217;t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/">we got excited</a> by <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/">Om Malik</a>, <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://justintimberlake.com/main/">musicians</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href="http://life.time.com/">Life</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href="http://observer.com/">New York Observer</a>, <a href="http://www.compliance.gov/">government websites</a>, a <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs-a-wordpress-filesystem/">filesystem</a>, <a href="http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress&#8217; development: today it&#8217;s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we&#8217;re working on a book about our history.</strong> We&#8217;re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It&#8217;s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary. To learn about the very early days of WordPress, just after Mike and I forked b2 <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/history/">you can download Chapter 3 right here</a>. We&#8217;ll be releasing the rest of the book serially, so watch out as the story of the last ten years emerges.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/"> I penned my own letter to WordPress</a> and other community members have been sharing their thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2013/01/25/wordpress-a-10-year-journey/">Mike Little on our Ten Year Journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Core contributor Helen Hou-Sandi <a href="http://helen.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/happy-10th-wordpress-and-thanks-from-my-little-family/">wishes WordPress happy birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>Peter Westwood on <a href="http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/">a decade gone</a>.</li>\n<li>Support rep Mika Epstein <a href="http://ipstenu.org/2013/you-me-and-wp/">on her WordPress journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Dougal Campbell <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/05/27/instagram-my-wife-suzecampbell-and-i-celebrating-the-wordpress-10th-anniversary-with-bbq-in-our-wordpress-shirts-wp10/">celebrating with his wife, Suze</a>.</li>\n<li>Otto on <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2013/how-wp-affected-me/">how WordPress affected him</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how WordPress&#8217; 10th Anniversary was celebrated all over the world <a href="http://wp10.wordpress.net/">by visiting the wp10 website</a>, according to Meetup we had 4,999 celebrators.</p>\n<p>To finish, I just want to say thank you to everyone: to the developers who write the code, to the designers who make WordPress sing, to the worldwide community translating WordPress into so many languages, to volunteers who answer support questions, to those who make WordPress accessible, to the systems team and the plugin and theme reviewers, to documentation writers, event organisers, evangelists, detractors, supporters and friends.

With hundreds of parties going on today, it&#8217;s more visible than ever just how popular WordPress has become.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you to everyone who has ever contributed to this project: your labors of love made this day possible.</strong></p>\n<p>But today isn&#8217;t just about reflecting on how we got this far (though I thought <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/">Matt&#8217;s reflection on the first ten years</a> was lovely). We are constantly moving forward. As each release cycle begins and ends (3.6 will be here soon, promise!), we always see an ebb and flow in the contributor pool. Part of ensuring the longevity of WordPress means mentoring new contributors, continually bringing new talent and fresh points of view to our family table.</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased to announce that this summer we will be mentoring 8 interns, most of them new contributors, through <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code</a> and the <a href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember">Gnome Outreach Program for Women</a>. Current contributors, who already volunteer their time working on WordPress, will provide the guidance and oversight for a variety of exciting projects  this summer. Here are the people/projects involved in the summer internships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Ryan McCue</strong>, </strong>from Australia, working on a JSON-based REST API. Mentors will be Bryan Petty and Eric Mann, with a reviewer assist from Andrew Norcross.</li>\n<li><strong>Kat Hagan</strong>, from the United States, working on a Post by Email plugin to replace the core function. Mentors will be Justin Shreve and George Stephanis, with an assist from Peter Westwood.</li>\n<li><strong>Siobhan Bamber</strong>, from Wales, working on a support (forums, training, documentation) internship. Mentors will be Mika Epstein and Hanni Ross.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick Ding</strong>, from the United States, working on improving portability. Mentors will be Andrew Nacin and Mike Schroder.</li>\n<li><strong>Sayak Sakar</strong>, from India, working on porting WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS. Mentor will be Eric Johnson.</li>\n<li><strong>Alex Höreth</strong>, from Germany, working on  adding WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. Mentors will be Dominik Schilling and Aaron Campbell, with a reviewer assist from Daniel Bachhuber.</li>\n<li><strong>Mert Yazicioglu</strong>, from Turkey, working on ways to improve our community profiles at profiles.wordpress.org. Mentors will be Scott Reilly and Boone Gorges.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniele Maio</strong>, from Italy, working on a native WordPress app for Blackberry 10. Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did you notice that our summer cohort is as international as the #wp10 parties going on today? I can only think that this is a good sign.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a difficult process to decide which projects to mentor through these programs. There are always more applicants with interesting ideas with whom we&#8217;d like to work than there are opportunities. Luckily, WordPress is a free/libre open source software project, and anyone can begin contributing at any time. Is this the year for you? We&#8217;d love for you to join us as we work toward #wp20. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif'' alt='';)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/the-next-10-starts-now/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 11 May 2013 03:44:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2584";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:374:"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3 is now available!

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies">sponsorship information</a><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general. (Pick us, pick us! <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif'' alt='':)'' class=''wp-smiley'' />  )</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The summer installment of the Gnome Outreach Program for Women follows the same schedule and general application format as GSoC, though there are more potential projects since it covers more areas of contribution. Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply… Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br />\n<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/summer-mentorship-programs-gsoc-and-gnome/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:51:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"WordPress 10th Anniversary Tees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 16:40:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Events";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Store";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"swag";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"wp10";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2561";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:338:"In honor of the upcoming 10th anniversary celebrations, we&#8217;ve put a special 10th anniversary tshirt in the swag store at cost &#8212; $10 per shirt plus shipping.

For starters, these two get bonus points for adding a settings link that is accessible from the Plugin management page. I wish more plugins would do that. Just drag the icons representing the social networks you want to use to the Enabled Social Services box. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8077" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarSetup.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarSetup.jpg?resize=500%2C368" alt="Floating Social Bar Setup" class="size-large wp-image-8077" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Configuring This Plugin Is Easy!</p></div>\n<p>You can alter the text that displays to the left of the icons, determine where those buttons show up, add your Twitter username and configure the interval to update stats which are displayed to the right of each icon. I believe this varies between themes but depending upon how long the text is before the social icons, it will force some of them to the next line, which is not pretty. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8078" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarIcons.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarIcons.jpg?resize=495%2C96" alt="Floating Social Bar Icons" class="size-full wp-image-8078" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">As seen in the Twenty Eleven Theme</p></div>\n<p>My personal preference is to have sharing icons located below the post content, near some of the meta data as seen on WPTavern articles. This plugin doesn&#8217;t allow that, at least not from its settings page. This is one of the reasons why Publicize by Jetpack will be a better option. Publicize gives users options to control the look of the icons and where they are located. With Floating Social Bar, the icons are stuck at the top of the post.</p>\n<p>This plugin provides a quick and easy way to display sharing icons without all of the additional functionality that comes with Publicize in JetPack. If that&#8217;s what you need, this plugin is excellent. If you&#8217;re looking for more flexibility, especially for how these icons are displayed, I suggest using Publicize in Jetpack. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/q7E9HaMqxAY" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 00:18:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: Creating A Digital Publication In WordPress With The IssueM Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8068";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:128:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/nR1Xamk6kl4/creating-a-digital-publication-in-wordpress-with-the-issuem-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2006:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IssueMLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IssueMLogo.jpg?resize=74%2C81" alt="Issue M Logo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8074" /></a>Built by LewAyotte, Peter Ericson, and Glenn Ansley the recently released open-source plugin known as <a href="https://issuem.com" title="https://issuem.com">IssueM</a> provides publishers the opportunity to harness the ease of WordPress to turn their site into an Issue based publication. After taking a look at <a href="http://issuem.com/showcase/" title="http://issuem.com/showcase/">their showcase</a>, I decided to try out the plugin for myself. </p>\n<p>I installed the plugin on my demo test site and had a hard time maneuvering around and getting things setup the way they were supposed to. Out of the box, it&#8217;s difficult to know how things are supposed to be setup. I hope in the future, these guys take full advantage of <strong><a href="http://www.paulund.co.uk/introduce-wordpress-pointers" title="http://www.paulund.co.uk/introduce-wordpress-pointers">Pointers</a></strong> that were added to the core of WordPress 3.3.

WPVote was described by many as a Digg like site but for WordPress. </p>\n<p><strong>First off Ben, tell us a little bit about who you are and what you&#8217;ve been up to these days.</strong></p>\n<p>Hi Jeff. I have been working online since the early 2000&#8242;s, and started with WordPress around 2004. I released a free theme that was one of the first added to <a href="http://wordpress.com/" title="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> &#8211; and after I started <a href="http://prothemedesign.com/" title="http://prothemedesign.com/">prothemedesign.com</a> which I still run today. Currently I am still building themes, with the best being premium themes on wordpress.com.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s been 3 years since the launch of WPVote. In that period of time, are you happy with the results of your experiment?</strong></p>\n<p>WPVote has been a fantastic learning experience for me. Honestly &#8211; it never took off as I would have liked &#8211; but I was able to achieve everything I set out to do. In addition, and what many people probably don&#8217;t think of &#8211; is that when building WPVote I created a product that I sold on <a href="http://prothemedesign.com/" title="http://prothemedesign.com/">prothemedesign.com</a> &#8211; and it has done quite nicely for me.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wpvotelogo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wpvotelogo.png?resize=238%2C50" alt="WPVote Logo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3101" /></a></p>\n<p>That said &#8211; since you first asked me about doing this interview WPVote has been under a sustained flood of traffic, which has made the site un-responsive. There are patterns to the traffic, but the blocks I have put in place haven&#8217;t helped and the rest of the site doesn&#8217;t respond. Without improving my hosting (which isn&#8217;t financially viable) I think the future of wpvote is in doubt at the moment :(</p>\n<p><strong>Can you share some statistics regarding the site such as submissions, new user registrations, etc?</strong></p>\n<p>Well &#8211; <a href="http://wpvote.com/" title="http://wpvote.com/">wpvote.com</a> currently has <strong>10,022 users</strong> and <strong>1,962 public posts</strong>. I haven&#8217;t measured how many but wpvote automatically deletes old posts that point to websites/web pages that no longer exist. As such, there&#8217;s probably a couple hundred posts that have been removed. There&#8217;s currently about 20 users who are consistently posting new content to the site, with 5 to 10 new posts a week being published. The (legitimate) traffic to the site isn&#8217;t huge but it has a good pagerank so it can be a nice bonus for your site.</p>\n<p><strong>From the outside looking in, I haven&#8217;t seen WPVote become a destination hotspot to see what&#8217;s happening in the world of WordPress. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>\n<p>My biggest problem, with everything I do (I&#8217;m well aware that this is a weakness), is marketing. I don&#8217;t have the network &#8211; or the skills/ knowledge &#8211; that others in the community have. Poststat.us has shown that this type of website in the WordPress niche can work &#8211; and I&#8217;m really pleased Brian managed to do it. In addition Poststat.us has managed to keep the content higher quality &#8211; presumably through a more manual review process which is bound to have helped.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPVoteFrontPage.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPVoteFrontPage.jpg?resize=398%2C265" alt="WPVote Front Page" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8063" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Are there any specific lessons you&#8217;ve learned by operating WPVote in the past three years?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot about programming and developing complex themes. I probably shouldn&#8217;t say this about a product I still sell, but I&#8217;d quite like to rewrite Nominate. I&#8217;ve also learned a lot about WordPress itself &#8211; using functionality you wouldn&#8217;t normally use in a theme. Things like submitting posts &#8211; and integrating spam management tools, more complex admin tools, and using wp-cron to automatically check on validity of old content. It&#8217;s been a really good way to grow as a developer.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NominateTheme.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NominateTheme.jpg?resize=516%2C305" alt="Nominate Theme" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8064" /></a></p>\n<p>In my article <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/ben-gillbanks-launches-wpvote" title="http://www.wptavern.com/ben-gillbanks-launches-wpvote">where I described the launch of WPVote</a>, I mentioned near the end that it would be cool to see something like WPVote replace the WordPress planet feed so the community played a larger role in determining what was shown on the front page. Have you had any inquiries regarding this? Is it something you would like to pursue?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a few inquiries to buy/invest in the site but I&#8217;ve turned everyone down so far. I&#8217;m not really in this for the money &#8211; I wanted to do it because I think WordPress is awesome and I wanted to try to help promote the community.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t had any inquiries regarding syndicating the content for something more <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress.org</a> related but doing something like that would be awesome &#8211; I&#8217;m certainly open to considering things like this (if I can ever get the site live again).</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;d like to know your thoughts regarding PostStat.us and their recent redesign. It looks like the site is gaining traction and is starting to gain more user based submissions.</strong></p>\n<p>I think the PostStat.us redesign is fantastic. IMO It&#8217;s not very visual &#8211; and the design is quite dry. It plays down the social/ community aspect &#8211; but the content is great and it&#8217;s building itself up nicely. Since PostStat.us is mostly about the community and writing opinion pieces based upon submitted content/ news &#8211; I think it would be nice to showcase the other sites more, possibly through website screenshots (like on wpvote) or perhaps some other means.</p>\n<p>The thing I am missing with WPVote is the community actively submitting and (more importantly) voting on the content. If people don&#8217;t interact then there&#8217;s no point running the site. PostStat.us does have people voting on content, and the manually curated content which probably makes it a more desirable destination for people looking for WordPress content.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have anything on tap with the WPVote website that you&#8217;d like to share?</strong></p>\n<p>At the moment my focus with wpvote is trying to get it back online.

According to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/domains/" title="http://wordpress.org/about/domains/">domain policy</a>, this is a violation of the WordPress trademark unless they have explicit permission. A couple days ago, I came across one such site which was brand new and the press release talked about their recent launch. I sent the owner of the site a message letting them know that they were violating the trademark and that they should think about a WP variant. While some responses are vulgar, the one from this person showed that they had made a mistake as they had no idea about the policy. Below is a short conversation over email. I&#8217;ve removed the person&#8217;s name as well as their website as it&#8217;s not needed to illustrate the point.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff</strong> &#8211; I read a press release today about the launch of (Name Of Service) and I just wanted to let you know that by using the full term of WordPress in the domain name, you are violating the WordPress trademark. http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/ I suggest switching your domain name to WP****** if possible or try obtaining permission to use the trademark in your domain name.</p>\n<p><strong>Response</strong> &#8211; Oh damn it, thanks for letting me know! I had no idea. I&#8217;ll see what I can do about changing the name. Kind regards,</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff</strong> &#8211; You&#8217;re welcome. Tons of people make the same mistake. Sorry you have to go about changing the domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Response</strong> &#8211; I looked into it yesterday and yeah, I really (bad word) up here. I bought the domain wp***** and migrated the whole site there, I&#8217;ll be 301 redirecting the whole site today. I&#8217;m sorry if I caused any bad feelings about my venture, just trying to make a living helping others with the CMS I love. I&#8217;ll be changing my email too in the next couple of days. Thanks for reaching out and letting me know so I could change the domain. I really appreciate it.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff</strong> &#8211; Nope, no bad feelings caused. I usually send out a friendly email to anyone violating the trademark as it&#8217;s best to deal with it early versus having that domain be established. You should be all set to go now. Good luck with your service. Oh, as a sidenote. I would look for any where you wrote Word(lowercase p)ress on the site and change it to WordPress as that&#8217;s the correct way to write it. It&#8217;s one of those weird prickly points the community has.</p>\n<p><strong>Response </strong>- Hi, Yeah, I found the discussion on Twitter, it seemed to cause a big stir among some. Saw some guy called me a douche for missing the capital P so I&#8217;ve changed it already. Thanks</p>\n<p>A couple of reasons why I published our email exchange. The first is to show that sometimes, people have good intentions but make an honest mistake. They didn&#8217;t know about the domain policy and rushed to change things to make it right. The established people in the WordPress community know about these guidelines and instead of chastising those site owners, we should first reach out to them via email or some other method to at least give them an opportunity to make things right. <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffr0/status/357576328234549250" title="https://twitter.com/jeffr0/status/357576328234549250">I started the Twitter dialogue</a> by mentioning how disappointed I was to see brand new WordPress services launch that violated the WordPress trademark. On Twitter, it&#8217;s too easy to fire off text that would be better off never being published. I&#8217;ve said a few things in the past I regret as have others. Let&#8217;s try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt before performing regretful actions. </p>\n<p>If you see anyone violating the WordPress trademark via by domain or other means, please try reaching that person via email or getting in touch with them any way possible to let them know. It could just be an honest mistake.</p>\n<p>I almost feel like these two articles need to be appended to every post ever written about WordPress.

We&#8217;ve made it through another week of widgets, fields, posts and plugins. It&#8217;s time to unwind with another installment of The Daily Plugin. We&#8217;ve got some really shiny new plugins to look at today in addition to some recent updates. The plugins listed represent a mere sampling of the most recently updated and newly released plugins from the WordPress Plugin Repository. Keep in mind that these plugins, like any plugin, should be tested on a staging site first to make sure that it works with your particular project parameters. Some plugins don&#8217;t work well with certain themes or other plugins. It&#8217;s always smart to test first to make sure all the plugins are working well together and performing as you expect them all to in harmony. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/suggest-review/assets/screenshot-2.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Suggest Review WordPress Plugin" src="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/suggest-review/assets/screenshot-2.png?resize=218%2C24" /></a><a title="Suggest Review WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/suggest-review/" target="_blank">Suggest Review</a> encourages users of the site to raise awareness of suspect or inaccurate content that may already be published to the site. It provides the viewer the opportunity to &#8220;flag&#8221; content and write a note to the administrator explaining the nature of their alert. I like the nature of the &#8220;suggestion&#8221; as it is done as a privately submitted form rather than out in public full view. The simple fact that this is a constructive mechanism for content revision, as opposed to the &#8220;comment trolls&#8221; is a welcome relief. There are safeguards in place that can restrict who sees or can submit to the &#8220;suggest review&#8221; button and functions. You can limit it to registered users so that the public or spammers are not pounding the system with false posts.</p>\n<p><a title="Microblog Poster WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/microblog-poster/" target="_blank">Microblog Poster</a> promises the ability to cross-post your newest content to multiple social sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, Plurk, Diigo and Delicious. While I am still testing this on my staging sites, I can report that so far I&#8217;ve run into nothing but success. There are very few plugins out there that integrate with LinkedIn properly. Microblog Poster handled all my posts with relative ease. While I use other plugins to handle my Twitter and Facebook notifications, this one will make a favorable addition to many of the WordPress sites that I frequently update content in. I anticipate that the developer will add more social sites as they become available as well.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/insert-estimated-reading-time/screenshot-1.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Insert Estimated Reading Time" src="http://i2.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/insert-estimated-reading-time/screenshot-1.png?resize=119%2C90" /></a><a title="Insert Estimated Reading Time WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-estimated-reading-time/" target="_blank">Insert Estimated Reading Time</a> helps to list an approximate reading time to your posts. The time calculation is based on a variable that you enter in the plugin&#8217;s settings screen. You have the option of displaying minutes or minutes/seconds in the display, as well as the template used, i.e. &#8220;This article will around XX minutes to read. Make sure you have a full beer before beginning.&#8221;. Quite a handy gadget to have at the start of your posts, especially if you tend to post a lot of lengthy content.</p>\n<p><a title="Comment CaVa WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/commentcava/" target="_blank">CommentCaVa</a> sets a virtual timer on your posts before a reader is allowed to make a comment. The concept is unique in that it forces the viewer to actually read the content first before they can comment. I&#8217;m not sure of the anti-spam implications of this plugin, but it may stop the flow on that end as well. It works within the native WordPress commenting system by installing a small JavaScript containing the timer elements. This is a new plugin with a developer that&#8217;s hungry to grow the functionality of the plugin, so please join <a title="Wordpress Profile for WortWart" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/wortwart/" target="_blank">WortWart</a> in making this plugin something that we can all use to extend on-page time of our readership.</p>\n<p>Well another week of The Daily Plugin is in the books. This weekend I&#8217;ll be taking it easy and hitting some outdoor events with my lovely wife. I&#8217;ll be back on Monday with a bit of a surprise for all of you Daily Plugin fans out there that have a commute. You can follow me on Twitter <a title="Marcus Couch on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/marcuscouch">@marcuscouch</a> or leave your feedback right here on <a title="The Daily Plugin for 7-19-2013" href="http://wptavern.com/the-daily-plugin-for-07-19-2013">WPTavern.com</a>.

It&#8217;s already Thursday and The Daily Plugin has yet to find that perfect plugin that you&#8217;ve been &#8220;<em>Repository Diving</em>&#8221; for all week-long. Well today is your lucky day my friend. Not because we may have found that hidden gem you&#8217;ve been on the hunt for, but because we saved you at least one day of having to look for it yourself. It&#8217;s a dirty job, but someone has to do it. Remember to prevent your own sites from becoming a cesspool of non-functioning calamity, always test these plugins on a staging site. You never know what kind of damage new plugins can do to a site without proper evaluation and investigation. Even the smallest function of a plugin can turn a site and its theme completely upside-down. Also, let&#8217;s remember that the plugins that follow are merely a sampling of the newest and most recently updated plugins found in the WordPress Plugin Repository. They are not endorsed in any official capacity.

Data included in the analysis includes Moz Rank, MozTrust, page authority ranking, Total links (both internal and external) and anchor text metrics. This provides a great opportunity to analyze and re-optimize existing content on your site that you depend on for a constant flow of traffic. I&#8217;ve had great experiences using Moz in the past for analysis of client sites. It will be great to incorporate some of the same functionality directly into the WordPress content editor. Give it a shot if you have the least bit of curiosity as to how your writing style coördinates with what should be optimized in your content. You may be surprised to learn that with just a few minor edits and tweaks, you can get a page to rank quickly and keep it there. This is a free usage plugin, but it will require registration to Moz for an API key.</p>\n<p><a title="WP Welcome Message" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-welcome-message/" target="_blank">WP Welcome Message</a> displays an intro &#8220;<em>pop-up</em>&#8221; box for new visitors to your site. The content of the pop-up is created using a standard WordPress rich editor, allowing you to add any kind of content, HTML or short codes to your pop-up. The CSS elements conformed to my site with little challenge. This is a simple, easy way to add a brief introduction to yourself, talk about a special event or promotion, or any other need you see fit.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/automatic-post-date-filler/assets/screenshot-1.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Automatic Post Date Filler WordPress Plugin" src="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/automatic-post-date-filler/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=184%2C100" /></a><a title="Automatic Post Date Filler" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-post-date-filler/" target="_blank">Automatic Post Date Filler</a> has a lot of intriguing uses, especially for someone like me who adds scheduled content to over 70 different WordPress installs on a monthly basis. The plugin works by setting a custom date and time for scheduled posts. Sort of like a smart playlist, it uses variables like &#8220;Current Date + X days&#8221; or &#8220;Time from the Furthest Scheduled Post + X Minutes&#8221; to determine how you would like the system to automatically schedule your next post. This is a fantastic &#8220;on deck&#8221; model to handle scheduled posts, making sure that all posts are as evenly spaced out as possible when published. It&#8217;s also great to prevent a mass post dump from happening all at once by automatically applying the scheduling limitation rules. It also provides an alternative button in your post editor, &#8220;Publish Immediately&#8221; which will override the scheduling filters and publish without any time alterations.</p>\n<p><a title="Better User Profile Fields" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-user-profile-fields/" target="_blank">Better User Profile Fields</a> is something that incorporates a multitude of Social networking profiles into the standard WordPress user profile including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Deviant Art and Tumblr. It can also use this data to populate different elements of your theme or content as well, simply by inserting PHP. For example, to add the Twitter profile URL of the user you would use <strong>get_author_meta(&#8216;twitter&#8217;)</strong>. Anyone who is a regular listener to <a title="Wordpress Plugins A-Z Podcast" href="http://wppluginsatoz.com">WordPress Plugins A-Z</a> knows that for years I have been screaming out for better usage of user profiles and the fields that we populate in them. This has all the elements to be a great plugin with a lot of great integration possibilities within themes and widgets. Something that has been lacking in WordPress for quite some time.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/wp-hashgrid/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=182%2C106"><img class="alignleft" alt="WP Hashgrid on Default WordPress theme" src="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/wp-hashgrid/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=182%2C106" /></a><a title="WP Hashgrid" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-hashgrid/" target="_blank">WP Hashgrid</a> is a pure design and developer tool that acts as a grid overlay to your WordPress site. Implementing the hashgrid.js script to overlay a CSS-customizable grid, this plugin helps to keep things centered and in alignment. In the old days I used to print a grid on clear transparency sheets and tape them to the monitor for modifying and finalizing layouts. My, how far we&#8217;ve come!

By the way, in Drew&#8217;s <a href="http://fotd.werdswords.com/what-is-this/" title="http://fotd.werdswords.com/what-is-this/">introduction post</a>, he listed 1,003 filter hooks.

security is one of those things in life I find fascinating. It&#8217;s a constant battle between good and evil. Just when the good guys think they have things figured out, the bad guys change their techniques. With all of the good that comes from using Cloud based services, there is also the other side of the coin. Cybersquared, a company dedicated to network and cyber security <a href="http://www.cybersquared.com/killing-with-a-borrowed-knife-chaining-core-cloud-service-profile-infrastructure-for-cyber-attacks/" title="http://www.cybersquared.com/killing-with-a-borrowed-knife-chaining-core-cloud-service-profile-infrastructure-for-cyber-attacks/">published a report with their findings</a> on how today&#8217;s attackers are using what they call, <a href="https://www.cybersquared.com/hiding-in-the-clouds/" title="https://www.cybersquared.com/hiding-in-the-clouds/">Service Profile Infrastructure</a> to facilitate command and control a.k.a. C2 phases of attack. </p>\n<p>In this report, it was highlighted that a Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat group used Dropbox and its file sharing notification feature to email links to targets that contained malicious binaries. This was considered phase 1 of the attack. Phase 2 worked with a WordPress.com hosted blog which acted as the command and control center. Once the malicious binaries were in use, the malware contacted the blog which hosted content that contained the IP address as well as the port number to receive commands from. </p>\n<p>Here is a screenshot from the WordPress.com account mentioned in the report. <del datetime="2013-07-18T15:49:25+00:00">The site is still online but I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s actively being used in malware attacks.

It would then read attacker staged content from within the blog posting to obtain a secondary domain, IP address and port number of a second stage C2 host.</p>\n<p>In this example at “gressered.wordpress[.]com”, we found multiple blog posts, all of which had likely served as content for specific targeting campaigns.  The same C2 configuration was “hiding in plain sight”. However, it is entirely possible that the attackers could have modified the second stage C2 configuration at any point previously. The earliest post was dated July 31, 2012, suggesting that this specific blog has been in use for nearly a year as a first stage interaction point.</p>\n<p>Many of the blog posts that contained the C2 configuration were associated with news articles related to geopolitical events, likely of interest to potential targets.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I can&#8217;t emphasize enough that <strong>no vulnerabilities in WordPress</strong> were used to carry out these attacks. This report shows that cloud services such as Dropbox and websites such as WordPress.com which are usually whitelisted are being used as infrastructure to carry out attacks. I encourage you to read the full report as it breaks down the process step by step. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/zf2_bigVSLM" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 18:50:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: Official WordPress Jobs Site Looking For Volunteer Moderators";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7985";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:123:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/rvPCII3G3WU/official-wordpress-jobs-site-looking-for-volunteer-moderators";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2677:"<p>When <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/secrets-revealed-wltc-and-wptavern" title="http://www.wptavern.com/secrets-revealed-wltc-and-wptavern">Matt Mullenweg announced</a> that he had purchased WPTavern as well as WeblogToolsCollection.com, another online property he received that wasn&#8217;t mentioned at the time was <a href="http://jobs.wordpress.net/" title="http://jobs.wordpress.net/">jobs.wordpress.net</a>.

As <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/meta/2013/07/17/seeking-2-moderators-for-jobs-wordpress-net/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/meta/2013/07/17/seeking-2-moderators-for-jobs-wordpress-net/">announced on the Make.WordPress.org website</a>, there has been a call for volunteer moderators for the website. The jobs board is still a popular destination but the amount of work required for one individual is daunting. The post outlines what is involved with the moderation process and the type of skills necessary to complete the work. It&#8217;s very encouraging to see that a number of people have already stepped up to help moderate this new community resource. </p>\n<p>On a WordPress jobs related note, PostStat.us just published their Summer edition of <a href="http://poststat.us/whos-hiring-in-wordpress-summer-edition/" title="http://poststat.us/whos-hiring-in-wordpress-summer-edition/">Who&#8217;s Hiring In WordPress</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/rvPCII3G3WU" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 16:39:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"WPTavern: The Daily Plugin for 07-17-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7958";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/ZJ6X6SqnVx0/the-daily-plugin-for-07-17-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8046:"<p>We start early in the morning every day. Like the farmer extracting fresh eggs from his trusted hens, we&#8217;re up at the crack of dawn to examine the quality of each new plugin submitted to the WordPress Plugin Repository. Some are Grade A Extra Large, some are just a cracked shell with nothing inside. Either way, let&#8217;s get cracking and whip up today&#8217;s Daily Plugin Omelette. Remember that not all plugins play well with others. Make sure you test them on a secondary staging site before you take anything to a live site. We preach it, we live it. Follow our example and you&#8217;ll be thankful. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a title="First Google Map" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/first-google-map/" target="_blank">First Google Map</a> employs one of my favorite slogans, &#8220;Keep It Simple&#8221;. Often times when we&#8217;re trying to insert a simple Google map, the plugins or embed code we use is too bloated, doesn&#8217;t display titles correctly or are too difficult to set up ahead of time. In comes &#8220;First Google Map&#8221; that allows you to insert a plain language formatted address to display your Google Map. The shortcode is rather simple and uses common sense taxonomy in its options. For example, if you wanted to show Mr. Mullenweg&#8217;s new rumored Tony Stark style mansion location, simply enter: [googlemap title=''Matt''s Beachfront Cottage'' width=450 height=300 zoom=14]31250 Broad Beach Rd, Malibu, CA[/googlemap] and the map will embed inline in your content area with appropriate overlay title of your choosing. Pretty nice way to insert on the fly. I could not find a direct option to choose the &#8220;satellite&#8221; view option over the standard road-only mode, which was the only real drawback. Other than that, it would be nice to have more control over the size of the address font that overlays the map. Most addresses that I tried were hyphenated by the plugin because the font was too large and it flowed into the next line. Control over these elements would be great, even if just another call-out function from within the shortcode.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wp-chart-generator.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7960" alt="Wp-chart-generator sample output" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wp-chart-generator.jpg?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="WP Chart Generator" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-chart-generator/" target="_blank">WP Chart Generator</a> helps to embed an on-the fly 3D pie chart with multiple options, an automatic key and a nice hover dialogue that highlights each section when the user moves their mouse over the graph. The developer may need assistance converting this to English, as it&#8217;s completely in French. Fortunately, it&#8217;s so easy to use that the language barrier really didn&#8217;t make much difference. The shortcode is pretty easy to create within the plugin options, which allows you to copy the correct shortcode to embed within your posts. In the past I&#8217;ve used Google chart API callouts for embedding simple graphs, but for pie charts, this one takes the cake!</p>\n<p><a title="GSpeech" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/gspeech/" target="_blank">GSpeech</a> is a text to speech plugin that uses Google to read selected text aloud. At first I thought it would be just one of those &#8220;Type Something in the box and I&#8217;ll read it&#8221; type of plugins. I was sorely inaccurate. This plugin can incorporate full speech to read when certain scenarios occur, such as hovering over a tab to hear the tab&#8217;s navigation title read out loud. There are also hover-on, hover-off possibilities as well. When a site visitor hovers over the &#8220;about us&#8221; page, perhaps it can just start reading your bio aloud. It&#8217;s an interesting plugin for serving those with eyesight disabilities, but also an ideal educational platform as well. It may be used in combination with a gallery for a &#8220;storybook&#8221; type presentation. Even job training could be utilized using this kind of plugin to read instructions out loud. Great effort from those at <a title="2Glux" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/2glux/" target="_blank">2Glux</a> who developed this.</p>\n<p><a title="I Recommend This" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/i-recommend-this/" target="_blank">I Recommend This</a> scales back our traditional feedback mechanism by removing comments and relying on a simple &#8220;like&#8221; system instead. Included in the plugin is widget functionality that can display the most popular &#8220;liked&#8221; posts. Cookies are also utilized to prevent abuse of users over-liking your posts. You have the option to not show all the ZERO likes that you may have on your post. Once you get a like, it starts displaying on the post. Nice way to hide all the goose eggs (zeroes) that will be blatantly mocking you while you or other users browse through your site. It&#8217;s a good alternative to some of the mainstream Twitter/FB likes or the standard thumbs up / thumbs down ratings plugins that are out there. The developer <a title="Dreams Media" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/dreamsmedia/" target="_blank">Dreams Media</a> really thought it through with IP logging and Cookie tracking to prevent abuse. Additionally you can remove the IP logging to save system resources. Worth a try if you want to keep a fully enclosed like system to replace comments. Good for business sites that may not want to allow commenting, yet show a favorable presentation that someone out there likes their content. Great recently updated plugin.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-easy-albums-photos-video-and-music-next-gen/screenshot-4.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Easy Albums for BuddyPress" src="http://i2.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-easy-albums-photos-video-and-music-next-gen/screenshot-4.jpg?resize=180%2C178" /></a><a title="Easy Albums for BuddyPress" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-easy-albums-photos-video-and-music-next-gen/" target="_blank">Easy Albums</a> is a new plugin for BuddyPress that allows the user base to upload their own audio files, playlists, images and videos to be displayed and organized in their own personalized albums. Not only does this allow a lot of media functionality from your user base, but it encourages commenting from other users as well. From an activity stream perspective, each user&#8217;s new media posts are shown within the timeline. While I love the functionality and flexibility that this all provides, the problem with this plugin from my perspective is that is requires a login from a third-party hosting server that the media is uploaded to. It is nearly perfect otherwise. A fully supported WPMU and Buddypress solution for full user media participation. Ideal for social and business applications of BuddyPress alike. If we could tie it to our own hosting or from Amazon or Dropbox without the additional login, I would gladly pay the developer <a title="Itaynoy" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/itaynoy/" target="_blank">Itaynoy</a> a premium for it.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all the eggs in the basket for now.

Some of these items are highlighted below, and a full changelog for 1.8 is available <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/releases/version-1-8/">on the BP Codex</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Better theme integration</em></p>\n<p>Since BuddyPress 1.7, BP has been compatible with practically every WordPress theme. But traces of the BuddyPress Default theme were still everywhere to be seen, in particular concerning the way that buttons, fonts, and form elements were styled. In BuddyPress 1.8, we&#8217;ve made a thorough review of our stylesheets to make them more minimal &#8211; we call it a &#8220;de-theming&#8221; &#8211; so that BP inherits CSS styling more gracefully from the active WordPress theme. We&#8217;re thrilled with how seamlessly BuddyPress 1.8 integrates with a variety of WordPress themes, and we think you&#8217;ll be thrilled too.</p>\n<p><em>Template hierarchy</em></p>\n<p>One of the most powerful tools available to WordPress theme developers is <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy">template hierarchy</a>, which defines a set of file naming conventions for context-specific template overrides. BP 1.8 extends this concept to top-level BuddyPress templates &#8211; the templates that are first located when loading a BuddyPress page. Let&#8217;s say, for instance, that you want your Groups directory to have a single-column layout, while the rest of your BuddyPress content has a right-hand sidebar. Simply create a single-column page template in your theme at <code>buddypress/groups/index-directory.php</code>, and BuddyPress will use this file, instead of the fallback <code>page.php</code>, when loading the Groups directory. Documentation of this new feature can be found <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/theme-development/template-hierarchy/">on the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Developer goodies</em></p>\n<p>1.8 is loaded with improvements aimed at making it easier and more fun than ever to develop for the BuddyPress platform.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The popular <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/plugin-development/group-extension-api/">Groups Extension API</a> has seen a complete rewrite, fixing long-standing bugs, adding new configuration options, and dramatically streamlining the process of extending <code>BP_Group_Extension</code>.</li>\n<li>The <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/developer-docs/loops-reference/the-activity-stream-loop/">activity</a> and <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/developer-docs/loops-reference/the-groups-loop/">groups</a> loops now support filtering by <code>''meta_query''</code>, using syntax familiar from <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Custom_Field_Parameters">WP_Query</a>.</li>\n<li>Group member directories are powered by the new <code>BP_Group_Member_Query</code>, which extends the flexible tools of <code>BP_User_Query</code> to the Groups component.</li>\n<li><a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/automated-testing/">Automated testing</a> is now built into the trunk and stable Subversion versions of BuddyPress, complete with flexible tools for <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/automated-testing/writing-automated-tests-for-buddypress-dependent-plugins/">testing BP-dependent plugins</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Artisans at work</h3>\n<p>In Midwood, Brooklyn, there&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiFara%27s">a pizzeria</a> where every pie is handmade by a single septuagenarian, and diners can wait two hours or more for a pizza of their own. While the BuddyPress team doesn&#8217;t like to make anyone wait (the 1.8 dev cycle has been our shortest ever, with every milestone hit right on schedule), we <em>do</em> like to think that we bring passion and care to BuddyPress that&#8217;s similar to Dom DeMarco&#8217;s single-minded pizza-making. So, we&#8217;re proud to name BuddyPress 1.8 &#8220;Di Fara&#8221; after Dom&#8217;s classic pizza joint.</p>\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n<p>As always, the BP core team extends appreciation to the scores of developers, designers, and community volunteers who have spent thousands of hours on this version of BuddyPress.

This is a recommended upgrade for all customers.</p>\n<p><a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/news/2013/07/introducing-the-ramp-post-id-meta-translation-plugin/">We also released</a> the <a href="https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-ramp-postid-meta-translation">RAMP Post ID Meta Translation plugin (hosted on GitHub)</a> that should make RAMP even more useful for more complex sites. It gives you the ability to designate certain custom fields (by key) to be treated as post IDs and translated as part of the RAMP deploy process.</p>\n<p>This means if you have a plugin that is storing a post ID as post meta to indicate a relationship, or perhaps an additional image (attachment) ID as post meta, those can now be properly converted to point to the content deployed to your production site. This was probably the top requested feature for RAMP, so I&#8217;m thrilled to be able to make it available.</p>\n<p class="threads-post-notice">This post is part of the project: <a href="http://alexking.org/project/ramp">RAMP</a>.

title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/16/migration-update-wxr-importer/">published an update</a> on his progress working with the WXR Importer. In this update, Frederick will begin the process of updating the WordPress WXR Importer plugin.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve also run the unit tests that apply to the importer plugin; however, the test cases are generally small (indeed, the biggest XML test case is 26 KB, titled small-export.xml) and don’t trigger the kinds of issues that importing dozens or hundreds of posts and attachments—with WXR files of megabytes in size—does.</p>\n<p>So, the first task at hand is breaking up the process—which currently executes in one step with little indication of progress—into discrete chunks that can run in separate, stateful (stepwise) requests.</p>\n<p>A chat with my mentors has pointed me in the direction of WP_Importer_Cron, which was first developed for other importers that need to make external API calls (e.g. Tumblr Importer) potentially subject to rate constraints. There are some parallels between “external API calls” and “remote attachment fetching”, which is why this can be a suitable approach for fixing the timeout issues that present with the current WordPress importer. After the process is discretized, showing progress (an enhancement long overdue) will be easier.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m stoked to see Frederick not only concentrating on the functionality of the importer but also paying attention to the visual details such as showing import progress. There are a lot of eyeballs keeping track of this plugin hoping that Frederick&#8217;s work will pay off in an importer that does what it&#8217;s supposed to with minimal problems. I want to remind Frederick that if you need people to beta test your work, especially in the area of large export/imports, just say so.

In the interview, we learn the origin of his nickname Otto. However, I think one of the most interesting points in the interview are Otto&#8217;s thoughts on plugins. </p>\n<blockquote><p>If I have 100 plugins all doing their own thing, and I just combine them all into one file somewhere, then the code remains the same and there’s no advantages in doing so. Having them separate, with their own names, and their own descriptions, provides a way to keep track of things. I use snippets a lot too, but I put each snippet into its own plugin, for simplicity of management.</p>\n<p>The number of plugins doesn’t matter, the code is what matters, and where that code lives is unimportant. WordPress itself implements a lot of its own internal functionality in the same way a plugin would do so.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His response has been very consistent over the years. In 2011, he pretty much <a href="http://wpcandy.com/thinks/active-plugin-counts-just-dont-matter/#comment-198719" title="http://wpcandy.com/thinks/active-plugin-counts-just-dont-matter/#comment-198719">provided the same answer</a> when Ryan Imel of WPCandy published an article about the same topic. I also chimed in on this topic in 2011 where I discussed <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-quality-not-plugin-quantity" title="http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-quality-not-plugin-quantity">Plugin Quality, not Plugin Quantity</a>. This is one of those things in the world of WordPress that I&#8217;ve seen change over the past few years. The line of thought used to be that you could only run so many plugins before you ran into problems or, you shouldn&#8217;t run more than a certain amount.

If a project has a strong open source development community, an attempt to close it down should result in a fork of the project. As it happens, Movable Type Open Source was already forked.

Among the domain registration options are GoDaddy, NameCheap, and WordPress.com. The domain search also checks to see if that name is available on Twitter. When you click on the WordPress.com option, the domain field will automatically be filled in with that domain name. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SuperTavern.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SuperTavern.jpg?resize=407%2C278" alt="Super Tavern" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7931" /></a></p>\n<p>Thanks to the acquisition, the <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/register-domain/" title="http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/register-domain/">following WordPress.com support page</a> will need to be updated to explain how to use the newly acquired services to search for available names. </p>\n<p>Congratulations to Matt Mazur on being acqui-hired and becoming yet another Matt that is employed by Automattic.

The guide covers user roles and suggests numerous plugins to make it easier to collaborate. With the recent addition of Marcus Couch to this website, it&#8217;s the first time in the history of WPTavern that I&#8217;ve had more than one author contributing articles on a regular basis. </p>\n<p>This multiple author section of WordPress is a whole new world for me and one I&#8217;m interested in learning about. Based on the post from WPKube, I plan on trying out the following plugins: <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-author-bio/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-author-bio/">Better Author Bio</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-status-notifier/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-status-notifier/">WP Status Notifier</a>, and possibly <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/">Edit Flow</a> although at this stage, Edit Flow seems to be too much of what I don&#8217;t need with just one other contributor to the site. There is one other plugin I may experiment with called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors-plus/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors-plus/">Co-Authors Plus</a>. It allows me to assign an author to a post without having to create an additional user account. </p>\n<p><strong>What plugins do you use to make working with multiple authors easier?</strong></p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/0IxUcSBfgQc" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 20:21:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WordPress.tv: Brent Toderash: Finding the Right WordPress Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=20169";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/15/brent-toderash-finding-the-right-wordpress-plugin/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:678:"<div id="v-BbT5MxHY-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/20169/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/20169/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=20169&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/15/brent-toderash-finding-the-right-wordpress-plugin/"><img alt="Brent Toderash: Finding the Right WordPress Plugin" src="http://videos.videopress.com/BbT5MxHY/video-7f2e5fd1c6_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 19:25:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Alex King: My Content-Powered Projects Page";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://alexking.org/?p=17747";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://alexking.org/blog/2013/07/15/content-powered-projects-page";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7147:".threads-post-notice {\n	background: #e8e8e8;\n	padding: 10px;\n}\n.threads-post-notice a {\n	font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n<p>As <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2013/07/07/reorganizing">alluded to earlier</a>, I&#8217;ve cleaned up my <a href="http://alexking.org/projects">projects page</a> which is now powered by a new taxonomy, custom post type and the content I&#8217;ve generated here over the last decade plus.

Create a Projects Taxonomy (and Post Type)</h3>\n<p>I created two new taxonomies to power the Projects page.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Projects: the names of my various projects.</li>\n<li>Project Groups: to group my projects into buckets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991273">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>I then used the <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a> <a href="https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-tax-post-binding">taxonomy-to-post binding plugin</a> plugin to create a Project post type that is effectively a child of the Projects taxonomy. This way I will be able to add content, terms, featured images, etc. to my projects (in a very forward compatible way).</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991284">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<h3>2. Convert existing Categories and Threads to Projects</h3>\n<p>In my existing content structures I had both categories and <a href="http://alexking.org/project/threads">threads</a> that were dedicated to specific projects. I needed to convert those relationships to the new projects taxonomy I&#8217;d created.</p>\n<p>Changing the categories was straightforward, but there was a little more work for the threads because I needed to convert the related post types as well. I did separate SQL queries to get the various category and thread ids I needed to convert.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991297">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>Once everything was converted, I then ran a little code to save each term via the WordPress API so that the associated project post types content would be created (via the tax-post-binding library).</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991324">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>The existing terms are now fully converted to projects.</p>\n<h3>3. Create New Projects (with meta data)</h3>\n<p>Now that I had converted the existing categories and threads to projects, it was time to create the rest of the projects. I ended up creating a big array with lots of meta data so that I could run and test this locally, then replay it all on my live site.</p>\n<p>This code creates the new project groups taxonomy terms, the new project terms, and adds meta data to the associated project post types.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991315">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>I truncated that quite a bit as I inserted a <em>lot</em> of projects.</p>\n<h3>4. Assign Existing Posts to Projects</h3>\n<p>At this point we have all of our project terms and post types created, it&#8217;s time to use them.</p>\n<p>Finding the posts I wanted to put into each project wasn&#8217;t an exact science. I basically created a projects list, then did searches on my site to find the posts relevant to that project. Then I manually selected the post IDs for those posts, and put them into a big array.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991399">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t select the posts programatically because there&#8217;s a bit more nuance to choosing what is and isn&#8217;t applicable to a project than just a keyword search.</p>\n<p>As part of that process, I also added a &#8220;Projects&#8221; category to all of these posts. I use this to show links to the latest posts across all projects on the new page. I needed to add this category to all of the converted categories and threads too.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991415">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<h3>5. Expose the New Data to Create the Projects Page</h3>\n<p>With all of my data set up, the last step was to expose it to power the projects page. I decided to do this by creating a shortcode that would output the projects by group.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991434">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>This has a bit too much of a mix of template and presentation for my liking, but it works and refactoring it is pretty low on my list at this point. Next time I mess with that code, I&#8217;ll probably clean it up a bit.</p>\n<h3>6. Project Page</h3>\n<p>The final step in the process was to customize the output of the individual project page. I am outputting the description, related links and featured image from the bound post type, and I converted some of my Threads plugin code to show a timeline of posts in &#8220;newest first&#8221; order. I also added a &#8220;this post is part of a project&#8221; banner to the individual posts, again borrowing the code from the Threads plugin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://alexking.org/project/social">an example</a>.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I feel like the new <a href="http://alexking.org/projects">projects page</a> is a better representation of my projects, and will be more meaningful and maintainable in the future than the old static page was. It will also reward me for blogging more frequently by being more up to date as a result.</p>\n<p>All good things.</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:1">\nMore on this in a future post.&#160;<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id="fn:2">\nI probably could have done this earlier in the process, but didn&#8217;t think of the feature I wanted it for until later.&#160;<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p class="threads-post-notice">This post is part of the thread: <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/thread/content">Content Presentation</a> &#8211; an ongoing story on this site.

This gets us one big step closer to getting 3.6 out in the wild. There is no link yet to the Post Formats UI plugin. I know many are hoping to see that come soon after 3.6 is released.

He recently <a href="http://danielespinoza.me/selling-plugins-to-get-out-of-debt/" title="http://danielespinoza.me/selling-plugins-to-get-out-of-debt/">published his personal quest</a> to conquer non-mortgage debt by selling his plugins. The debt amounted to $67,000 and he was able to pay it off in just 8 months. He is now creating an emergency fund equal to six months of income. But how did he conquer that monster the majority of us know as debt? He made the tough choice to sell two of the first plugins he ever developed despite them bringing in 4-5 thousand dollars in monthly recurring revenue. The plugins he sold were Authorize.net, AIM, and PayPal Express.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were sick and tired of our debt hindering us from being able to follow our passion of slow travel with our family as digital tentmakers. Our one goal became cleaning up our financial mess and removing that hurdle. So when we received the offer to sell we asked “Does this get us to our goal?” and the answer was “Yes.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Congratulations Daniel on beheading the monster that is debt. I hope your story serves as inspiration for many others to accomplish the same feat. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/KpDYhG6qWAE" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 02:54:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"WPTavern: Week In WordPress Episode 5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7880";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/fFKmu2bWXUA/week-in-wordpress-episode-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1020:"<p>I invite you to watch <a title="http://slocumstudio.com/2013/07/week-in-wordpress-episode-5/" href="http://slocumstudio.com/2013/07/week-in-wordpress-episode-5/">Week In WordPress Episode 5</a> as yours truly and a group of WordPress faithful got together to discuss the news of the week.

Some people clip coupons, some collect stamps or dog trinkets. I dig through plugins. Lots of &#8216;em. The most mentionable are listed here in what we like to call The Daily Plugin. While I don&#8217;t consider this everyday offering to be a review, it&#8217;s certainly a spotlight on what plugins I feel the community can get the most usage out of. Your own circumstances and needs apply. Remember that these plugins are always to be tested on staging and development sites first as to not risk losing data or compromise speed or functionality when used in conjunction with your existing plugin set. OK, Let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a title="Similar Sites Menu" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/similar-sites-menu/" target="_blank">Similar Sites Menu</a> is an external sites &#8220;link menu&#8221; that acts as a secondary native menu in your top navigation bar. If you happen to run a sub domain or have sister sites this could be a really good option in which you can promote everything on the top-level. The theme that I tested this on did not play nice with the plugin when it came to CSS styling and matching the overall look and feel of my WordPress installation. However when I tested it on a secondary staging site they work great without any complications. I was able to edit the color scheme to match the site perfectly in just under three minutes. Any theme with a secondary menu could accomplish this task as well, but it&#8217;s nice to have another option when you need it.</p>\n<p><a title="Random Images" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/random-images/" target="_blank">Random Images</a> shows off the featured images within posts in a nice layout with uniformly sized thumbnails. When a thumbnail is clicked the plugin calls up a lightbox version of the enlarged image is shown with a link to the content item on top of the image. While I found that the functionality and overall design of this plugin was very appealing, the lightbox itself was not the result I was expecting. For the purposes of my own sites and content that resides within them, I would rather see this plugin serve the capacity in showing full post content rather than just images. I&#8217;m sure that this could be accomplished with just a bit of code revision, in addition to options of sharing the posts via social networking platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n<p><a title="TSP Featured Posts" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/tsp-featured-posts/" target="_blank">TSP Featured Posts</a> from The Software People gives you the opportunity to show off your posts in a simple Layout that can be easily managed and manipulated through shortcodes. After installing the plugin you make a determination as to your default thumbnail size and the length of the excerpt of the post that you&#8217;d like to display. Once all of those vital statistics have been entered into the system, you simply choose the category you&#8217;d like to display, how many posts you like, and the plugin does all the rest. This is a pretty good plugin for people who would like to tweak the themes without having to go through major code overhaul. There are certainly a number of themes that have this functionality built within the framework, but not all of them. I found this to be an excellent first entry from this particular developer and will be highlighting a few more plugins that they have released this week in the days that follow.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CSV-Test.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7870" alt="CSV-Test" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CSV-Test.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="CSV to Sort Table" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/csv-to-sorttable/" target="_blank">CSV to SortTable</a> has been recently updated, and it&#8217;s turning into the kind of plugin that may have more usage than the developer even intended. The plugin functions by calling an external CSV file from a URL of your choosing and transforms it into a sortable HTML table. It&#8217;s simple to do on a per post basis in the form of an easy shortcode, such as <strong>[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv], </strong>showing the direct path to the file. There are other shortcode options as well, like hiding/showing the top or bottom rows, etc. I tested this on a few different CSV files with great success. The tables all looked great right out of the gate with little modification. So how does this plugin work and what can be expanded from it? Well I tried a few scenarios. The first thing that I did was try to make changes to an already uploaded CSV file to see if it would update on the fly. It did. So we know that it updates the file in real-time. This can be good and bad. Good because it always has the newest data. Bad because it&#8217;s always trying to download and convert that file on the fly. The load time wasn&#8217;t worth abandoning the plugin over, so I tried a few more &#8220;hacks&#8221; to see if I could expand the range even further. I took the same CSV file and saved it to a local dropbox folder. Then I went to the Dropbox site to get a private link to the csv file. This worked! I imported straight from Dropbox. The one issue I had is that I then went back and made a few changes to the file and re-saved in Dropbox. Even after editing and re-synching the folder, the new revisions did not &#8220;take&#8221; with the plugin. It could be a cache issue or something on the end of Dropbox, but it&#8217;s a good idea for the developer to think about using services like Google Drive and Dropbox to feed the CSV source path. I would love the ability to edit files on the fly and have them self-update into pricing or product tables in near real-time. It&#8217;s almost perfect and certainly works well as intended. It would be nice to connect a few more pipes to it though.</p>\n<p><a title="Buddypress XProfile Custom Fields Type" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-xprofile-custom-fields-type/" target="_blank">Buddypress Xprofile Custom Fields Type</a> helps to add more user functionality and community within your BuddyPress installation. It allows several custom fields to be used in reference to your users, such as the user&#8217;s birthday, email address, custom post type selector results, image fields, check box acceptances (for terms of service or rules acknowledgement) and other custom fields of your choosing. It also provides the user with the option to hide or show selected information on their user profile. All the fields work within the BP Profile Search plugin, so the information becomes completely searchable. I&#8217;m relatively new to BuddyPress, having created only a few small-scale private member sites. Any help that can come in the form of easy to configure fields and user options is always a welcome relief. If you are in the same boat that I am regarding editing and managing BuddyPress, you&#8217;ll appreciate the flexibility that this plugin provides.</p>\n<p>Thank you once again for joining me in another edition of The Daily Plugin.

(Posting it is a great idea by the way, people will help you with it.) I began to think about mine, which was a little strange because I&#8217;ve been trying to move away from desiring things or experiences and just be more grateful in the present, but immediately a few music ones came to mind: have WordPress name-checked in a major hip-hop song, be in a rap video, and perform with one of my favorite artists (somehow).</p>\n<p>It was less than a week later I got an email from a friend who was helping organize a hush-hush event where Jay-Z would sing his song Picasso Baby over and over 6 hours while interacting with various artists and an audience as a performance piece, and there might even be an opportunity to be one of the people he interacted with. My jaw dropped.</p>\n<p><span id="more-42718"></span></p>\n<p>The entire experience was fairly surreal, <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/jerry-saltz-face-to-face-with-jay-z.html">this article by Jerry Saltz captured it well</a>, and in the end I did get to &#8220;perform&#8221; (in a very loose performance art sense) directly with Jay (we&#8217;re on a first syllable basis now), <a href="https://twitter.com/joshm/status/355090504586776576">which was even caught in a photo</a>.

However, they&#8217;ve recently launched a $5.00 per month/per site automatic backup plan. I caught up with the founders of this small service to see what their plans were for the future. </p>\n<p><strong>What is WP Remote and why did you decide to start the service?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote1.jpg?resize=500%2C106" alt="Track All Your Sites" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7706" /></a></p>\n<p>WP Remote is a service for monitoring and updating all of your WordPress sites. Human Made built the initial version a few years back out of necessity — a way of streamlining the repetitive tasks associated with managing our many client sites. We received positive feedback on WP Remote from those we showed it to, and decided to invest a bit of time releasing a public version.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s all included in the free account?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote2.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote2.jpg?resize=500%2C122" alt="Daily Automatic Backups" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7707" /></a></p>\n<p>WP Remote will monitor your WordPress sites for updates to plugins, theme, and WordPress core. If it finds any out of date software, you can update individually or all at once. WP Remote also lets you perform an on-demand backup of an entire site. Signing up is easy, so go ahead and give it a try.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to offer a free account?</strong></p>\n<p>Much of the community is built on sharing what you know and have. We thought making WP Remote publicly available was an appropriate way for us to contribute back.</p>\n<p><strong>How does this service differ from VaultPress or some of the other security monitoring services?</strong></p>\n<p>WP Remote doesn’t do any security monitoring at this time. We’re focusing on the best functionality for managing your WordPress sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you provide some of the technical details involved with the backups such as where they are stored and what makes them secure?</strong></p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote3.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote3.jpg?resize=421%2C133" alt="Serious About Security" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7708" /></a></p>\n<p>On your web host, the backup file is first generated with our open source HM Backup library. Our on-demand backup feature then streams the backup file from your web host to your computer. On the other hand, our premium Automatic Backups feature stores your backup file in an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket that we manage, making it very easy for users who are looking for a hands off approach.</p>\n<p><strong>How are you able to offer such a service at such an affordable price?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s been a labor of love so far. We’d like to invest much more time into improving WP Remote though. To help us justify this investment, we plan to introduce additional features worth paying for (a cost that you can also pass on to your clients).</p>\n<p><strong>Are there plans in the future to add the ability to be able to automatically restore a site from a backup?</strong></p>\n<p>No set plans, but restoring a site from backup (or cloning an existing site) is a feature we’d love as well. We do have a handy guide for people who want to restore their site from a backup. We’re always looking for people to check out WP Remote and send us feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s been the most common feedback you’ve received from your customers?</strong></p>\n<p>Funny you ask! We ran a survey just last week — one common request is for an email notification when you have a plugin or theme to update. We think this would be neat, and it would be even cooler to have WP Remote automatically upgrade plugins and themes it knew were safe to upgrade.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the long term goal of WP Remote?</strong></p>\n<p>To build a smart, intuitive application to manage our WordPress sites so we don’t have to. In doing so, we hope others grow to love WP Remote as much as we do. We are also working to expose an external API for WP Remote so developers can better integrate their own tools with us. We are pretty excited about the potential.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/5HKzkOgsY1A" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 22:22:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"WPTavern: Page.ly Launches New CDN Called PressCDN";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7855";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/yr-eYAEMv0c/page-ly-launches-new-cdn-called-presscdn";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3156:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PressCDNLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PressCDNLogo.jpg?resize=300%2C69" alt="PressCDN Logo" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7856" /></a>Page.ly <a title="http://blog.page.ly/2013/07/presscdn-the-cdn-for-those-that-love-wordpress/" href="http://blog.page.ly/2013/07/presscdn-the-cdn-for-those-that-love-wordpress/">has announced</a> a brand new CDN service called PressCDN. Page.ly has partnered with a number of companies in order to provide a global distribution network. The biggest selling point they are pushing is speed. For those that don&#8217;t know, CDN stands for Content Delivery Network.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A CDN is a content delivery network that stores copies of your images and site files in locations all around the world. This allows them to be downloaded to your visitor’s computer faster, speeding up the overall load time of your page.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At $9 dollars per month, it&#8217;s a cheap way to speed up a website but it&#8217;s not cheaper than free. <a title="http://jetpack.me/support/photon/" href="http://jetpack.me/support/photon/">Photon</a>, which is one of the services built into the Jetpack plugin provides CDN capabilities. When enabled, images will be served dynamically from the servers that power the WordPress.com cloud. However, Photon does have its limitations. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Photon filters content but doesn’t change the info in the database.</li>\n<li>Photon currently only acts on images in posts and featured images (post thumbnails).</li>\n<li>Photon will apply to old posts and new ones alike and can be turned on or off easily.</li>\n<li>No cache invalidations – currently the images are cached “forever”. If you want to “refresh” an image you will need to change the name of the image.&nbsp;Adding random query arguments, commonly known as cachebusters, will not work.</li>\n<li>We only fetch, resize, and serve&nbsp;<strong>gif, png, and jpg</strong>&nbsp;images from servers that listen on&nbsp;<strong>port 80</strong>. This is about 99.99% of the web servers in the world.</li>\n<li>We will not “upscale” an image in most circumstances.&nbsp;If your original image is 1000px wide and you ask for us to make it 5000px, we will serve you the original 1000px image.&nbsp;Upscaled images are usually of poor quality and we want to avoid that.</li>\n<li>If your server takes longer than 10 seconds to upload the image to Photon, the upload will time out and your image will appear to be broken. Try to upload a differently-named image with a smaller file size if this happens.</li>\n<li>Animated gifs will probably break if resized or transformed via Photon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On paper, using any type of CDN is supposed to be beneficial to both the site and its visitors. However, until we see some comparison benchmarks preferably from a third-party comparing speeds and services like PressCDN with Photon, we&#8217;ll never know.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/yr-eYAEMv0c" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 20:49:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:50:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.8 – Release Candidate 1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://buddypress.org/?p=167934";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://buddypress.org/2013/07/buddypress-1-8-release-candidate-1/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1025:"<p>BuddyPress 1.8 is so close you can smell it!

Since long form content has generated some of the most interest and engagement on the site, the redesign features a left-handed column devoted exclusively to the long form content while the right-hand sidebar will contain the typical links that visitors are accustomed to. This enables the long form content to stick around longer without being buried by the different content types. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/RedesignPreview.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/RedesignPreview.png?resize=500%2C345" alt="Post Status Redesign Preview" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7848" /></a></p>\n<p>Another large piece of the revamped site gives us a glimpse as to one of the ways Brian is looking to monetize the site.

Remember to install new plugins on a staging site first as to not expose your valuable sites to any risk of plugin conflict or crashes of your site. Also please consider that these plugins are not rated or suggested in any official capacity. This is merely my reaction to the latest plugins to be released. With that being said, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Easy-Responsive-Tabs-to-Accordion.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7826" alt="Easy Responsive Tabs to Accordion" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Easy-Responsive-Tabs-to-Accordion.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="Easy Responsive Tabs To Accordion" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-easy-responsive-tabs-to-accordion/" target="_blank">Easy Responsive Tabs to Accordion</a> is a visually appealing way to add a tab/content component to your responsive WordPress site. This is a lightweight jQuery plugin which optimizes normal horizontal or vertical tabs to accordion on multiple devices for Desktop browsers, tablets and Mobile viewing. This plugin adapts the screen size and changes its action accordingly. I found the display options to be very configurable and highly attractive. There have been a lot of tab plugins released in the last several months, but this is the first one that I&#8217;ve seen that is actually completely responsive. It has a high degree of added ability when it comes to editing CSS. I had a complete set of tabs up and running to conform with the look of my site within 10 minutes. Not too shabby. So if you or your clients have been clamoring for a refresh on their website design, this element might help spruce things up a bit and give you added functionality to boot.</p>\n<p><a title="Featured Image from Google Images" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/featured-image-from-google-images/" target="_blank">Featured Image from Google Images</a> has some pretty intriguing elements to it. Rather than having you upload a featured image into the media gallery, you instead can simply search based on keyword and find results in the Google images pool. With just a few clicks you can add that image straight into your blog without having to download it and upload it ahead of time. While I think this is a pretty fantastic way to add images, I do worry about copyright infringement and the implications that it might bring about. Using Google images is often a shortcut that we&#8217;re all guilty of. We need to also remember that there are photographers behind those images that should also be compensated for their creativity and hard work. If you&#8217;re going to use a plugin like this I would encourage you to stick with what is generally accepted as public domain or Creative Commons licensed material. Otherwise you run the risk of getting into trouble (or getting your client in trouble) because someone down the line forgot to purchase a license agreement for the images used. I&#8217;ve seen it happen several times, so if you are going to use this add-on, make sure to use common sense in doing so. Here&#8217;s a video that summarizes the functionality and setup of this plugin.</p>\n<div class="aligncenter"></div>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/meetup-winner/assets/screenshot-1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Meetup Winner! WordPress Plugin" src="http://i1.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/meetup-winner/assets/screenshot-1.jpg?resize=207%2C159" /></a><a title="Meetup Winner" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/meetup-winner/" target="_blank">Meetup Winner!</a> is a plugin that taps into the Meetup.com API. I&#8217;ve not run across anything that has Meetup API functionality in the past, so I decided to check this one out. The basis of this plugin is basically one that allows you to reward those who RSVP to one of your meetups. How it works is that you set up an event ID shortcode corresponding to your individual event. Once at the event, you can call up the page where the shortcut resides and the plugin will randomly pick from those who have RSVP to the meeting. It will display the person&#8217;s name and the picture associated with them at meetup.com. I find this quite encouraging that different plugins are being developed around meetup.com. <strong>Regarding Meetup.com:</strong> Though there are some questionable groups that can be found on the site, I have found invaluable resources and relationships garnered at my local Southern California WordPress meet up group, which happens to be the <a title="OC WordPress Group on Meetup.com" href="http://www.meetup.com/OC-Wordpress-Group/" target="_blank">OC WordPress meetup</a> headed by <a title="Steve Zehngut on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/Zengy" target="_blank">Steve Zehngut</a>. With other power WP users like Jason Tucker and Suzette Franck, co-hosts on the weekly <a title="Wordpress Water Cooler" href="http://www.wpwatercooler.com/">WP WaterCooler</a> Hangout. It&#8217;s one of the more active among WP Meetups. I applaud the concept and integration of this plugin and look forward to even more Meetup.com WordPress integration in the future. Hopefully this also means I might win something at a future meetup!</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/lateralpress/assets/screenshot-1.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="LateralPress" src="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/lateralpress/assets/screenshot-1.jpg?resize=151%2C137" /></a><a title="LateralPress WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/lateralpress/" target="_blank">LateralPress</a> is an interesting java based design plugin that allows you to display an animated scrolling timeline of content relative to the post date and a custom post type modifier. I found this plugin to be quite visually appealing. However the JavaScript time did take a while to load in the test application that I tried on a staging site. While posts set up for previous posts to be included in this plugin&#8217;s display is a tedious process, the results are rather difficult to compete with when it comes to final output. I think this would be an excellent plugin for people who would like to tell a story with their content over an evolutionary period of time. It adds a lot of visual appeal to what would otherwise be a boring about us or bio page on your WordPress installation.</p>\n<p>Thank you for joining me in another installation of the Daily Plugin.

The move comes as a shock to many within the WordPress community, including me. WPDaily was spearheaded by John Saddington, leader of the development team <a title="http://8bit.io" href="http://8bit.io">8Bit</a> and project manager of <a title="http://pressgr.am/" href="http://pressgr.am/">PressGram</a>. While no direct cause of the shutdown was given, John noted that while the site achieved a variety of goals, it did not achieve the larger global goals and strategy of their organization at the present time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We achieved every single goal and metric that we had set out to accomplish (and then some) in this glorious experiment and so we consider it a “success.” But, it did not achieve the much larger global goals and strategy of our organization at this present time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One thing I can confirm is that criticism and negative reactions to some of their published content was definitely not a reason for the shutdown. I give John a lot of credit for everything he did with WPDaily. The man was a publishing machine and if you blinked, you missed a ton of content. I occasionally joked that John published so much content that he was the reason infinite scroll was invented. Everywhere I looked, I saw John Saddington with the first comment on posts. This just shows how much he was on the ball with information. I know from experience that the only way John could accomplish what he did with WPDaily involved ridiculously long hours, lots of typing, living within the inbox, and juggling his time with reviewing products and just being in touch with people. For anyone that thinks running a community news type website is easy, you&#8217;re wrong. It&#8217;s very difficult. It requires lots of time reading, communicating, piecing together stories, managing the conversations that take place and a host of other responsibilities. This is why I continue to think that if you don&#8217;t have a primary source of funding, that creating a site like WPDaily or WPTavern just isn&#8217;t worth it in the long run.</p>\n<p>However, the shutdown of WPDaily stirred up the conversation again around WordPress news sites and how they can be sustainable. According to one individual, the curation of WordPress content can not be achieved by 1 person or 10 but rather, <a title="https://twitter.com/wptavern/status/355084349428871169" href="https://twitter.com/wptavern/status/355084349428871169">should be an automated process</a>. Then, you could charge access to the site as it would do all of the filtering for you. Hard to say if that idea would take off but the site I have in mind that could potentially make this work is <a title="http://poststat.us/" href="http://poststat.us/">PostStat.us</a>. Brian Krogsgard has <a title="https://twitter.com/Krogsgard/status/355088909039968256" href="https://twitter.com/Krogsgard/status/355088909039968256">stated on Twitter</a> that he has a few tricks up his sleeve to monetize the site but we will have to wait until they are implemented to find out what they are.</p>\n<p>I want to personally say to John Saddington that I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and especially with PressGram. At the same time however, I make a formal request that you highly consider leaving the content archived somewhere for reference material or you either sell, or provide the archive to someone who is more concerned with the historical significance of the content than any other agenda.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, I want to thank the individuals who suggested to others that they can use WPTavern to get their fix for WordPress information. However, WPTavern can not and will not be a direct replacement for WPDaily. Both sites contain their own unique flavors, takes on various topics that come up in the community.</p>\n<p>*<strong>Update</strong>*<br />\nAs of July 11th 2013, the site has been turned back on and is in Archive mode. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/GfJmcCF51tk" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 23:51:20 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.7.3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://buddypress.org/?p=167873";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:47:"http://buddypress.org/2013/07/buddypress-1-7-3/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1197:"<p>BuddyPress 1.7.3 is now available.

Watch the live video stream from the comfort of your home on July 26 and 27; WCSF t-shirt, or any shirt, optional.</p>\n<p>I hope to see you there.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 09 Jul 2013 23:50:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Matt Mullenweg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"WordPress.tv: Randy Hoyt: Structured Data in WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=20455";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/09/randy-hoyt-structured-data-in-wordpress/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:658:"<div id="v-RFBm2TTZ-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/20455/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/20455/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=20455&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/09/randy-hoyt-structured-data-in-wordpress/"><img alt="Randy Hoyt: Structured Data in WordPress" src="http://videos.videopress.com/RFBm2TTZ/video-d88108f1d1_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 09 Jul 2013 19:16:19 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 05:05:19 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"173019";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 04:45:27 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130722041715";}', 'no');

Cuándo esa persona es perdida a causa de alguna persona o la negligencia de grupo, la mala conducta, o el descuidado, nuestra tristesa es aún más grande. Sabiendo que la muerte no fue necesaria, que las acciones de alguien o inacciones lo causaron, es producto de una muerte injusta.\n\nLos parientes más cercanos o la familia sobreviviente pueden archivar un reclamo de la muerte si ellos creen que la muerte resulto de la negligencia, de la mala conducta, o del descuidado. Los casos como estos son trágicamente comunes y pueden surgir de una variedad de causas. Algunos de éstos incluyen exposición innecesaria a sustancias perjudiciales como asbesto, las reacciones a Vioxxa y otras medicinas, la negligencia u otra negligencia en la parte de profesionales médicos, accidentes de automóvil que es causado por descuidado o la conducción temeraria, inclusive conductores en estado de embriaguez, y las muertes que es causado por productos defectuosos de que el fabricante supo de o debe haber sido consciente.\n<h3>Qué Es lo que Significa"Muerte Injusta"</h3>\nUna variedad de casos y muertes puede ser consideradas como una muerte injusta. En esencia, una muerte injusta es uno que es innecesario y eso sólo ocurrió a causa de la negligencia de alguien, la mala conducta, el descuidado,o por sus acciones. Una muerte injusta puede venir acerca de instantáneamente, como durante un accidente de automóvil, o lentamente, como después de exposición al asbesto.\n<h3>¿Qué Es Algunos Ejemplos de la Muerte Injusta?</h3>\nRecientemente, ha habido un número creciente de muertes del mesothelioma, un resultado de exposición de asbesto. Esta exposición puede resultar de fabricantes que pueden ser mostrados para ser negligentes o de las companías que fallan de notificara a sus trabajadores acerca de la presencia de asbesto y no proporcionar la protección adecuada contra ello.\n\nY no es justo asbesto. Las personas se mueren innecesariamente después de que sea expuesto al Benceno. La exposición a los vapores que vienen de soldar barras también puede ser un asesino, y el descuidado o la negligencia en la parte de las companías que hacen estos productos o los grupos que los utiliza también pueden tener como resultado una muerte injusta.\n\nLas companías farmacéuticas, también, pueden ser responsable de los que fueron matados utilizando sus productos, incluso si el producto fuera utilizado como dirigido. Merck, el fabricante de Vioxxa, ha sido encontrado responsable de las muertes que vinieron acerca de a causa de efectos secundario de esa droga, y de otras drogas semejantes también han sido encontradas de causar muertes.\n<h3>¿Qué Puedo Hacer yo Si Creo que algun miembro de su familia ha Sufrido una Muerte Injusta?</h3>\nLos que se quedan después de que alguien muere por causa de una muerte injusta se siente naturalmente frustrado y permitido a la compensación. La muerte es siempre un tiempo muy estresante, y si esa muerte fue innecesaria y causada por otros o por otra persona, los sentimientos son pronunciados aún más. La muerte puede crear no sólo tristeza y consternación, pero consecuencias financieras graves si la persona que se muere fue el unico cuyos ingresos sostuvieron a sufamilia.\n\nSi la muerte resultó de un accidente de tráfico, los efectos secundario de medicinas, de la negligencia, o de cualquiera de varias condiciones igualmente trágicas, los miembros restantes de la familia pueden tener derecho para recibir compensación para su pérdida innecesaria y drástica.\n\nSi usted cree que la muerte de un miembro de su familia fue el resultado de una muerte injusta, usted debe contactar A Las Officiinas de Ley de David Azizi para que uno de nuestro abogados personal experienciado de muertes injustas pueda proporcionar acción iguala a su cuidar.

En el momento del incidente, el demandante sólo había trabajado para su empleador por 1 ½ semanas. Su trabajo consistía en operar una carretilla elevadora para descargar las cajas de los remolques. Demandante había alrededor de 9 años de experiencia trabajando con carretillas elevadoras de carga y descarga de productos.\n\nEn el día del incidente, un compañero de trabajo con más experiencia y antigüedad que el Demandante, le pidió a el demandante que le ayudara a descargar una paleta con cual el estaba teníendo problemas .El demandante fue a remolque y sus co-empleado instruido a el demandante a ponerse de pie junto a la carga y utilizar sus manos por encima de su cabeza para estabilizar la carga mientras que su compañero de trabajo trató de levantar la carga con el montacargas. La carga consistía en 24 cajas de bobinas de acero. La carga pesaba 1,600 libras. mientras que su co-empleado trató de levantar la paleta, toda la carga cayó aplastando demandante. Como resultado del incidente, el demandante quedó paralizado.\n\nDemandante contenio que el remolque había sido cargado impropiamente. El método utilizado violava todas las normas de la industria. El remolque se cargó incorrectamente a partir de cada concebible consideración. La carga estaba cuatro capas de alto. La capa más alta era la capa más pesada. La carga de 1600 libras bobinas nunca debería haber sido colocado en la parte superior de otra carga. Además, la carga de bobinas era más ancha que la carga directamente debajo asiendo la carga inestable. Peor aún, la tercera y la cuarta capas de los productos fueron colocados en una muy estrecha e inestable segunda capa. Fue formado en esencia como un triángulo invertido con la carga más pesada en cima. Además, la tercera capa, directamente debajo de la paleta 1,600 libras de bobinas eran largas filas de estrecho, poco embalado cajas de techo toldos. Los pedasos sueltos de techo no estaban atados en cualquier forma y, por tanto, resbaló sobre, pasando como el remolque se trasladó en el transporte causando las 1600 libras de carga de bobinas de cambiar y avanzar sobre el remolque al azar.\n\nEl último factor que hizo este accidente catastrófico fue una virtual certeza de la manera en que la compania de el demandado avia envuelto su carga para el transporte. Las 1600 libras de cajas de bobinas se encogen envueltos juntos pero nunca se adjunta a la paleta de madera. Las normas de la industria exige que el envoltorio retráctil de carga deberá adjuntarse a la paleta para prevenir exactamente el tipo de accidente que ocurrió en este caso. La carga debería haber sido envuelto alrededor de la paleta de acero y luego aver sido unidos. La Empresa Demandada se deberia haber encargo de envolver bien y la garantía de su carga antes de que se le dio al demandado para el transporte.\n\nEl demandante sufrió una fractura de T-12 con la participación neurológicas.

From a discussion between myself and <a href="http://mikelittle.org/">Mike Little</a> about <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It&#8217;s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won&#8217;t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it&#8217;s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn&#8217;t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href="http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; &#8220;b2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.&#8221; b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren&#8217;t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress&#8217; developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href="http://ryan.boren.me/">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site&#8217;s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href="http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress &#8212; a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we&#8217;ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href="http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it&#8217;s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn&#8217;t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about developers. WordPress&#8217; strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our &#8220;famous 5 minute install&#8221;. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn&#8217;t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn&#8217;t write code, it didn&#8217;t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/">we got excited</a> by <a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/">Om Malik</a>, <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href="http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://justintimberlake.com/main/">musicians</a> and <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href="http://life.time.com/">Life</a>, <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href="http://observer.com/">New York Observer</a>, <a href="http://www.compliance.gov/">government websites</a>, a <a href="http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs-a-wordpress-filesystem/">filesystem</a>, <a href="http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href="http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress&#8217; development: today it&#8217;s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we&#8217;re working on a book about our history.</strong> We&#8217;re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It&#8217;s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary. To learn about the very early days of WordPress, just after Mike and I forked b2 <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/history/">you can download Chapter 3 right here</a>. We&#8217;ll be releasing the rest of the book serially, so watch out as the story of the last ten years emerges.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/"> I penned my own letter to WordPress</a> and other community members have been sharing their thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2013/01/25/wordpress-a-10-year-journey/">Mike Little on our Ten Year Journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Core contributor Helen Hou-Sandi <a href="http://helen.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/happy-10th-wordpress-and-thanks-from-my-little-family/">wishes WordPress happy birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>Peter Westwood on <a href="http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/">a decade gone</a>.</li>\n<li>Support rep Mika Epstein <a href="http://ipstenu.org/2013/you-me-and-wp/">on her WordPress journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Dougal Campbell <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/05/27/instagram-my-wife-suzecampbell-and-i-celebrating-the-wordpress-10th-anniversary-with-bbq-in-our-wordpress-shirts-wp10/">celebrating with his wife, Suze</a>.</li>\n<li>Otto on <a href="http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2013/how-wp-affected-me/">how WordPress affected him</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how WordPress&#8217; 10th Anniversary was celebrated all over the world <a href="http://wp10.wordpress.net/">by visiting the wp10 website</a>, according to Meetup we had 4,999 celebrators.</p>\n<p>To finish, I just want to say thank you to everyone: to the developers who write the code, to the designers who make WordPress sing, to the worldwide community translating WordPress into so many languages, to volunteers who answer support questions, to those who make WordPress accessible, to the systems team and the plugin and theme reviewers, to documentation writers, event organisers, evangelists, detractors, supporters and friends. Thanks to the jazzers whose music inspired us and whose names are at the heart of WordPress. Thanks to everyone who uses WordPress to power their blog or website, and to everyone who will in the future. Thanks to WordPress and its community that I&#8217;m proud to be part of.</p>\n<p>Thank you.

We are constantly moving forward. As each release cycle begins and ends (3.6 will be here soon, promise!), we always see an ebb and flow in the contributor pool. Part of ensuring the longevity of WordPress means mentoring new contributors, continually bringing new talent and fresh points of view to our family table.</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased to announce that this summer we will be mentoring 8 interns, most of them new contributors, through <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code</a> and the <a href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember">Gnome Outreach Program for Women</a>. Current contributors, who already volunteer their time working on WordPress, will provide the guidance and oversight for a variety of exciting projects  this summer. Here are the people/projects involved in the summer internships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Ryan McCue</strong>, </strong>from Australia, working on a JSON-based REST API. Mentors will be Bryan Petty and Eric Mann, with a reviewer assist from Andrew Norcross.</li>\n<li><strong>Kat Hagan</strong>, from the United States, working on a Post by Email plugin to replace the core function. Mentors will be Justin Shreve and George Stephanis, with an assist from Peter Westwood.</li>\n<li><strong>Siobhan Bamber</strong>, from Wales, working on a support (forums, training, documentation) internship. Mentors will be Mika Epstein and Hanni Ross.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick Ding</strong>, from the United States, working on improving portability. Mentors will be Andrew Nacin and Mike Schroder.</li>\n<li><strong>Sayak Sakar</strong>, from India, working on porting WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS. Mentor will be Eric Johnson.</li>\n<li><strong>Alex Höreth</strong>, from Germany, working on  adding WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. Mentors will be Dominik Schilling and Aaron Campbell, with a reviewer assist from Daniel Bachhuber.</li>\n<li><strong>Mert Yazicioglu</strong>, from Turkey, working on ways to improve our community profiles at profiles.wordpress.org. Mentors will be Scott Reilly and Boone Gorges.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniele Maio</strong>, from Italy, working on a native WordPress app for Blackberry 10. Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did you notice that our summer cohort is as international as the #wp10 parties going on today? I can only think that this is a good sign.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a difficult process to decide which projects to mentor through these programs. There are always more applicants with interesting ideas with whom we&#8217;d like to work than there are opportunities. Luckily, WordPress is a free/libre open source software project, and anyone can begin contributing at any time. Is this the year for you? We&#8217;d love for you to join us as we work toward #wp20. <img src=''http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif'' alt='';)'' class=''wp-smiley'' /> </p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/the-next-10-starts-now/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:42:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:55:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 11 May 2013 03:44:41 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"Development";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2584";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:374:"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3 is now available!

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px" href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies">sponsorship information</a><span style="font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general.

Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply… Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br />\n<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/summer-mentorship-programs-gsoc-and-gnome/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:51:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"WordPress 10th Anniversary Tees";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 16:40:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Events";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"Store";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"swag";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"wp10";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2561";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:338:"In honor of the upcoming 10th anniversary celebrations, we&#8217;ve put a special 10th anniversary tshirt in the swag store at cost &#8212; $10 per shirt plus shipping.

once again time to check out the newest and most recently updated plugins in the WordPress Plugin Repository. Today we have five additions that are worth taking a closer look at. But before you install these on a live site, make sure that you properly test them on a secondary staging site first. That way you know the plugin is an ideal match for you and can work well with the other plugins you already have installed. Remember that this post is not to be considered an endorsement or official review, but a sampling of the newest offerings from the Repository.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/failure_to_launch_800_6282.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8138" alt="LaunchKey - Failure to Launch" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/failure_to_launch_800_6282.jpg?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="LaunchKey WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/launchkey/" target="_blank">LaunchKey</a> is an authentication plugin that promises to &#8220;Kill All Passwords&#8221; for your WordPress logins. You begin by installing the plugin, downloading the app (iOS or Android) and then confirming your account via email. From there you are to login to launchkey.com and create an app API that will authenticate with your mobile device. Here&#8217;s where my investigation halted, at first at least. For the first 45 minutes, no matter what browser I tried, it would never let me log into my account on their website to create the API keys needed. I reached out to Launchkey on Twitter and finally had things working to API key stage after 3 uninstalls and re-installs. Once I had the API keys, it ground to a halt on my first attempt to retry wp-admin login. No matter what I did, {&#8220;error&#8221;:&#8221;invalid_request&#8221;} was the result in my browser when routing through their OAuth servers.</p>\n<p>After 3 API key changes on their site, it finally worked. So how does it work once it actually gets going? It uses your mobile device to allow you to login to your site based only on your Launchkey username. Once the username is entered, your mobile device is alerted and a notification comes up allowing you to &#8220;slide up&#8221; a toggle that permits the login. It also allows you to log off simply by sliding the &#8220;lock&#8221; to the right. One early issue that I found was that no matter what site I had tried to login as, the iPhone app always identified the authentication request as coming from &#8220;Launchkey OAuth&#8221; rather than any particular site name or URL. I can see where this would get really confusing really fast when dealing with multiple domains. How would I know what site is being logged into? Once more, if I am logging out by sliding on the names, how can I tell what I&#8217;m logging out of? It&#8217;s an interesting app/plugin combo adding another layer of security to your installation, or at least lending all your site credential trust to a third-party funnel, which has it&#8217;s own risks attached to it when misused. I like the concept and appreciate the quick help of the Twitter support team in getting me operational. Personally though, I don&#8217;t see the need for the average WordPress user to implement this. It&#8217;s not worth the risks or the cumbersome setup time. That&#8217;s just my opinion and your own needs may vary. For me, the launch key was turned and the rocket never got very far off the pad.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a neat app. Will I keep it installed? Not at the moment. I&#8217;ll check back with this one after they have a few revisions to see if they are ready for Prime Time. For now though, I&#8217;ll wait.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/buyhimabeer.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8129" alt="Buy Him A Beer" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/buyhimabeer.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="Buy Him A Beer WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/buy-him-a-beer/" target="_blank">Buy Him A Beer</a> is the perfect plugin for Jeff to install on this site. I&#8217;d rather call this one &#8220;Buy Me some single-malt Scotch&#8221;, but for continuity sake, we&#8217;ll stick with the beer references. This plugin is not like your typical PayPal based donation prompt. It actually allows you to pick out what beer you would like to buy someone. From a domestic standard to a seasonal microbrew rarity, &#8220;Buy Him A Beer&#8221; is a fun way to encourage tips or donations in your WordPress installation. The plugin runs on the database at buyhimabeer.com to feed the beer data into the system, but no account signup is required. It&#8217;s a great way to prompt donations to your site and fun for the person making the donation. I&#8217;ve tested it and it also works for females too, despite the name. I forsee a whole series of this. Buy me lunch, send me a pizza, pay for my dry cleaning and perhaps even feed my starving dog with a nice selection of treats. Of course that&#8217;s the marketer in me, always going for those heartstrings in order to make a conversion. Who know if we&#8217;ll install this on WPTavern, but it&#8217;s worth a shot (or at least a beer).</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/user-language-switch.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8147" alt="User Language Switch" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/user-language-switch.jpg?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="User Language Switch" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/user-language-switch/" target="_blank">User Language Switch</a> allows you to change the language on the front end or the back-end with just a simple flick of the switch. This is truly helpful if you work with people who speak another language and you want to switch back and forth to edit and work on the same WordPress installation. It also allows you to translate posts back and forth with an association between the native language and the translated versions. Several years ago I worked with a team in Spain on a WordPress project that could have really used a plugin like this for the back-end that we could have toggled languages on. If it ever comes up again, I&#8217;ll be sure to give this one a try on a live site.</p>\n<p>That will round out today&#8217;s batch of plugins. After all that struggle with LaunchKey, I really could use a beer. Anyone want to donate one? lol.

Remember to test your plugins on a staging site before going live. Make sure that all your plugins can party together without causing too much damage. Once you&#8217;re good to go, move them over to your live site and get the party started. Also remember that these are not reviews or official endorsements, but observations of what&#8217;s new out there that you may want to try out if the subject matter, functionality and layout meets your own individual site needs. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wpinterstitial.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8116" alt="WP Interstitial" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/wpinterstitial.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="WPStitial WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpstitial/" target="_blank">WPstitial </a> displays an interstitial ad screen when users visit a specific page, or any page within your WordPress installation. An Interstitial ad is often used by the larger content sites such as magazines or media outlets. It is a web page that is displayed before an expected content page, often to display advertisements or confirm the user&#8217;s age. Well now it&#8217;s no longer just the big boys that get to play in the interstitial sandbox. You too can thrill your readership with full-page ads designed to hide the content for just a few more seconds. I joke about that part, because interstitial ads, when used properly can be a very effective way to market to first time viewers of a web site. Whether it be baiting your readers with requests to follow you on social channels or enticing them with special offers, this plugin provides a platform in which to create easy full-page interstitial ads with the ease of the WordPress content editor. Full shortcode and HTML embedding is allowed on the page, as is a control over how often a person will see. In addition you can simply embed the URL of another site via iFrames. The plugin is also mobile optimized, so you can show the same ads on both platforms, formatted perfectly. Other controls include wait time adjustments and the cycle of ads that is rotated. Overall a good plugin to check out for yourself if you are looking for additional revenue streams for your high-traffic sites or to simply raise awareness of a particular event or campaign.</p>\n<p><a title="Only One Category WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/only-one-category/" target="_blank">Only One Category</a>, as the name implies limits the a post to having just one, single checked category. What a blessing! I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve checked a category, only to forget to un-check whatever default category was already selected. When this happens it generally puts things where they shouldn&#8217;t be and causes headaches having to go back in just to uncheck one little box. Now I&#8217;ll never have to again, and neither will you.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/visualizer.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8118" alt="Visualizer Chart Plugin" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/visualizer.jpg?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="Visualizer WordPress Chart Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/visualizer/" target="_blank">Visualizer</a> is another Google Charts API plugin that allows you to access the on-the-fly chart-making capabilities of Google Charts. Unlike other plugins of a similar theme, this one has all the bells and whistles built right into it, allowing you to create any type of chart that Google Charts offers directly within WordPress. From pie charts to line graphs, dot grids to candlesticks. If there&#8217;s data to be illustrated, there&#8217;s unlikely to be another source out there with the same capabilities all packed into a single plugin.</p>\n<p><a title="WP Image Borders WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-image-borders/" target="_blank">WP Image Borders</a> helps you easily add or remove custom border effects to your uploaded images. A few shows back on WordPress Plugins A-Z, a gentlemen left us an audio comment asking for an alternative for a Drupal module called &#8220;ImageCache&#8221;. I was never into Drupal, but this feature was quite amazing, allowing on-the fly image formatting and editing, including orientation correction, color adjustments, bevel, shadows, glow and many other effects that we often have to do offline at a time-consuming rate. While on the hunt for an answer to our listener&#8217;s request, I came across something similar that was just released in the Repository called WP Image Borders. While it&#8217;s nothing like the aforementioned ImageCache capability, it does provide some of the same &#8220;on-the-fly&#8221; image processing power. If you want to add drop shadows to all your images or make them round cornered, this is a good plugin to do that. It will not alter the original image and turning off the plugin will simply revert all your old images back to their original styles. Would love to see what people out there can create with this!</p>\n<p><a title="Simple Donation Manager" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-donation-managersdm/" target="_blank">Simple Donation Manager</a> assists in recognizing those who have contributed to the cause, no matter what that might be. The plugin uses a shortcode based system that displays donors and beneficiaries for a particular cause or fund-raising drive. So not only will it list out who donates, but it can list out who receives the help as well. While not quite Kickstart quality, this has a lot of uses for non-profit and charitable organizations out there who have the need to display such information with the ease of a shortcode. Full contact info can be used, including their method of payment for the donation.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for this edition of The Daily Plugin. Join us again tomorrow as we dig into the deepest chasm of the WordPress Plugin Repository in search of hidden resources and new gems to behold.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/RJPvl0ECb7w" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 15:25:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Marcus Couch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"WPTavern: The Daily Plugin for 07-23-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8052";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/BAscCKypc38/the-daily-plugin-for-07-23-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4830:"<p>Welcome once again to another installment of The Daily Plugin. Today we&#8217;re pleased to see that the WordPress Plugin Repository has just hit 26,000 plugins in the index. This is quite an accomplishment! I&#8217;m grateful to all the developers out there who put in thankless days and sleepless nights creating these magnificent plugins. They can&#8217;t all be a perfect 10 plugin, but the simple fact that people are making a solid effort to participate in the community is very commendable.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, make sure that you test out all these plugins on a staging site. It&#8217;s always best to create a mirror of a live site with an identical set of plugins. Then install the new plugin to see how it interacts with the others. After a day or so, you&#8217;ll get to know the functionality, speed and performance of the site with the new plugin installed. If everything seems to be cool, then it&#8217;s probably safe to remove the plugin from your &#8220;quarantine&#8221; and use it on an actual live site.</p>\n<p><a title="YouTube Comments" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/youtube-comments/" target="_blank">YouTube Comments</a> is yet another tentacle in the power of the commenting system. This little gem allows you to automatically pull in the comments from a YouTube linked video from within the post. I like this because it keeps my WordPress installation as the central hub for everything despite how many social services that I want to hook it to on the outside. The plugin allows comments by all users logged into YouTube. Hopefully this doesn&#8217;t become abused or has some degree of control of spam.</p>\n<p><a title="Blog Watch WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/blog-watch/" target="_blank">Blog Watch</a> helps you monitor the competition or fellow content creators right in your dashboard. It runs on both RSS and ATOM feeds. You simply add the feed URL and the posts will be inserted in the dashboard module. An added bonus is that if you do not know a specific feed URL, the plugin will attempt to locate it for you based on the main URL of the blog you want to monitor. This could be used to monitor the blogging activity streams of your favorite authors, sites with similar interests or anything you choose. Heck, why not double up and add the <a title="WP Tavern Feed" href="http://wptavern.com/feed/" target="_blank">WPTavern feed</a> to it as well, ok?</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/time-difference.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8086" alt="Time Difference" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/time-difference.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="Time Difference" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/time-difference/" target="_blank">Time Difference</a> calculates the amount of time between the current date of your WordPress installation and a date that you signify in shortcode form. The date can be either in the past or in the future. I like the versatility of this plugin, as it can act as a countdown timer to an event and as a running stopwatch of something that has started. It could be used in a number of practical ways. Days left in Summer, countdown to when school starts, days since you were born and on and on. Since it&#8217;s shortcode based, you&#8217;ll be able to use this within content as well as within a widget.</p>\n<p><a title="Free Voice Comment System" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/uemotioncom-free-voice-comment-system/" target="_blank">Free Voice Comment System</a> is another plugin I tried in hopes of finding a free solution for Speakpipe. This plugin ideally would have the same functionality in that a site viewer would be able to record an audio comment with just one click-through their browser. In the case of this plugin, it runs off a service called uemotion.com, a social messaging site based on audio recordings. I could not get the plugin to function at all after installation, from requesting an API key on down. This one is simple not ready for prime time, as the site crashes every time you try to request a key. I tried it on 3 different staging sites with the same result. Oh well. I&#8217;ll keep on searching.</p>\n<p>Last Friday I mentioned that there would be some news for those fans of the column that are commuters seeking an audio version of The Daily Plugin. After some consideration and discussion with Jeff, I&#8217;ve decided to give the people what they want and create a daily audio recording. We will wait until the next version of WordPress officially drops so that we can take advantage of using the new audio and video capabilities within the Media center. I can&#8217;t wait!</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/BAscCKypc38" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 18:23:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"Marcus Couch";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.6 Release Candidate 2";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:33:"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2649";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/07/wordpress-3-6-release-candidate-2/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1324:"<p>The second release candidate for WordPress 3.6 is now available for download and testing.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re down to only a few remaining issues, and the final release should be available in a matter of days.

For starters, these two get bonus points for adding a settings link that is accessible from the Plugin management page. I wish more plugins would do that. Just drag the icons representing the social networks you want to use to the Enabled Social Services box. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8077" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarSetup.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarSetup.jpg?resize=500%2C368" alt="Floating Social Bar Setup" class="size-large wp-image-8077" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Configuring This Plugin Is Easy!</p></div>\n<p>You can alter the text that displays to the left of the icons, determine where those buttons show up, add your Twitter username and configure the interval to update stats which are displayed to the right of each icon. I believe this varies between themes but depending upon how long the text is before the social icons, it will force some of them to the next line, which is not pretty. </p>\n<div id="attachment_8078" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarIcons.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarIcons.jpg?resize=495%2C96" alt="Floating Social Bar Icons" class="size-full wp-image-8078" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">As seen in the Twenty Eleven Theme</p></div>\n<p>My personal preference is to have sharing icons located below the post content, near some of the meta data as seen on WPTavern articles. This plugin doesn&#8217;t allow that, at least not from its settings page. This is one of the reasons why Publicize by Jetpack will be a better option. Publicize gives users options to control the look of the icons and where they are located. With Floating Social Bar, the icons are stuck at the top of the post.</p>\n<p>This plugin provides a quick and easy way to display sharing icons without all of the additional functionality that comes with Publicize in JetPack. If that&#8217;s what you need, this plugin is excellent. If you&#8217;re looking for more flexibility, especially for how these icons are displayed, I suggest using Publicize in Jetpack. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/q7E9HaMqxAY" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 00:18:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:76:"WPTavern: Creating A Digital Publication In WordPress With The IssueM Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8068";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:128:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/nR1Xamk6kl4/creating-a-digital-publication-in-wordpress-with-the-issuem-plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2006:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IssueMLogo.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IssueMLogo.jpg?resize=74%2C81" alt="Issue M Logo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8074" /></a>Built by LewAyotte, Peter Ericson, and Glenn Ansley the recently released open-source plugin known as <a href="https://issuem.com" title="https://issuem.com">IssueM</a> provides publishers the opportunity to harness the ease of WordPress to turn their site into an Issue based publication. After taking a look at <a href="http://issuem.com/showcase/" title="http://issuem.com/showcase/">their showcase</a>, I decided to try out the plugin for myself. </p>\n<p>I installed the plugin on my demo test site and had a hard time maneuvering around and getting things setup the way they were supposed to. Out of the box, it&#8217;s difficult to know how things are supposed to be setup. I hope in the future, these guys take full advantage of <strong><a href="http://www.paulund.co.uk/introduce-wordpress-pointers" title="http://www.paulund.co.uk/introduce-wordpress-pointers">Pointers</a></strong> that were added to the core of WordPress 3.3.

WPVote was described by many as a Digg like site but for WordPress. </p>\n<p><strong>First off Ben, tell us a little bit about who you are and what you&#8217;ve been up to these days.</strong></p>\n<p>Hi Jeff. I have been working online since the early 2000&#8242;s, and started with WordPress around 2004. I released a free theme that was one of the first added to <a href="http://wordpress.com/" title="http://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> &#8211; and after I started <a href="http://prothemedesign.com/" title="http://prothemedesign.com/">prothemedesign.com</a> which I still run today. Currently I am still building themes, with the best being premium themes on wordpress.com.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s been 3 years since the launch of WPVote. In that period of time, are you happy with the results of your experiment?</strong></p>\n<p>WPVote has been a fantastic learning experience for me. Honestly &#8211; it never took off as I would have liked &#8211; but I was able to achieve everything I set out to do. In addition, and what many people probably don&#8217;t think of &#8211; is that when building WPVote I created a product that I sold on <a href="http://prothemedesign.com/" title="http://prothemedesign.com/">prothemedesign.com</a> &#8211; and it has done quite nicely for me.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wpvotelogo.png" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wpvotelogo.png?resize=238%2C50" alt="WPVote Logo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3101" /></a></p>\n<p>That said &#8211; since you first asked me about doing this interview WPVote has been under a sustained flood of traffic, which has made the site un-responsive. There are patterns to the traffic, but the blocks I have put in place haven&#8217;t helped and the rest of the site doesn&#8217;t respond. Without improving my hosting (which isn&#8217;t financially viable) I think the future of wpvote is in doubt at the moment :(</p>\n<p><strong>Can you share some statistics regarding the site such as submissions, new user registrations, etc?</strong></p>\n<p>Well &#8211; <a href="http://wpvote.com/" title="http://wpvote.com/">wpvote.com</a> currently has <strong>10,022 users</strong> and <strong>1,962 public posts</strong>. I haven&#8217;t measured how many but wpvote automatically deletes old posts that point to websites/web pages that no longer exist. As such, there&#8217;s probably a couple hundred posts that have been removed. There&#8217;s currently about 20 users who are consistently posting new content to the site, with 5 to 10 new posts a week being published. The (legitimate) traffic to the site isn&#8217;t huge but it has a good pagerank so it can be a nice bonus for your site.</p>\n<p><strong>From the outside looking in, I haven&#8217;t seen WPVote become a destination hotspot to see what&#8217;s happening in the world of WordPress. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>\n<p>My biggest problem, with everything I do (I&#8217;m well aware that this is a weakness), is marketing. I don&#8217;t have the network &#8211; or the skills/ knowledge &#8211; that others in the community have. Poststat.us has shown that this type of website in the WordPress niche can work &#8211; and I&#8217;m really pleased Brian managed to do it. In addition Poststat.us has managed to keep the content higher quality &#8211; presumably through a more manual review process which is bound to have helped.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPVoteFrontPage.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPVoteFrontPage.jpg?resize=398%2C265" alt="WPVote Front Page" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8063" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Are there any specific lessons you&#8217;ve learned by operating WPVote in the past three years?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot about programming and developing complex themes. I probably shouldn&#8217;t say this about a product I still sell, but I&#8217;d quite like to rewrite Nominate. I&#8217;ve also learned a lot about WordPress itself &#8211; using functionality you wouldn&#8217;t normally use in a theme. Things like submitting posts &#8211; and integrating spam management tools, more complex admin tools, and using wp-cron to automatically check on validity of old content. It&#8217;s been a really good way to grow as a developer.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NominateTheme.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NominateTheme.jpg?resize=516%2C305" alt="Nominate Theme" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8064" /></a></p>\n<p>In my article <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/ben-gillbanks-launches-wpvote" title="http://www.wptavern.com/ben-gillbanks-launches-wpvote">where I described the launch of WPVote</a>, I mentioned near the end that it would be cool to see something like WPVote replace the WordPress planet feed so the community played a larger role in determining what was shown on the front page. Have you had any inquiries regarding this? Is it something you would like to pursue?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a few inquiries to buy/invest in the site but I&#8217;ve turned everyone down so far. I&#8217;m not really in this for the money &#8211; I wanted to do it because I think WordPress is awesome and I wanted to try to help promote the community.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t had any inquiries regarding syndicating the content for something more <a href="http://wordpress.org/" title="http://wordpress.org/">wordpress.org</a> related but doing something like that would be awesome &#8211; I&#8217;m certainly open to considering things like this (if I can ever get the site live again).</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;d like to know your thoughts regarding PostStat.us and their recent redesign. It looks like the site is gaining traction and is starting to gain more user based submissions.</strong></p>\n<p>I think the PostStat.us redesign is fantastic. IMO It&#8217;s not very visual &#8211; and the design is quite dry. It plays down the social/ community aspect &#8211; but the content is great and it&#8217;s building itself up nicely. Since PostStat.us is mostly about the community and writing opinion pieces based upon submitted content/ news &#8211; I think it would be nice to showcase the other sites more, possibly through website screenshots (like on wpvote) or perhaps some other means.</p>\n<p>The thing I am missing with WPVote is the community actively submitting and (more importantly) voting on the content. If people don&#8217;t interact then there&#8217;s no point running the site. PostStat.us does have people voting on content, and the manually curated content which probably makes it a more desirable destination for people looking for WordPress content.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you have anything on tap with the WPVote website that you&#8217;d like to share?</strong></p>\n<p>At the moment my focus with wpvote is trying to get it back online. In the future I would quite like to rewrite it as a voting plugin but I have so many other things I want to do that I don&#8217;t know when/ if that will happen.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Content:</h2>\n<p>Check out Ben&#8217;s <a href="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2009/12/building-wpvote-wordpress/" title="http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2009/12/building-wpvote-wordpress/">7 part series</a> that goes through the process of getting WPVote from idea, to working reality. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/N_vR4q15Mns" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 18:46:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: Friendly Reminder About The WordPress Domain Trademark";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8056";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:116:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/OPK4hi9ENjA/friendly-reminder-about-the-wordpress-domain-trademark";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4760:"<p>While reading press releases about new WordPress services or plugins, I&#8217;ll occasionally discover that their website uses the full term of WordPress in their domain name.

I&#8217;ve removed the person&#8217;s name as well as their website as it&#8217;s not needed to illustrate the point.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff</strong> &#8211; I read a press release today about the launch of (Name Of Service) and I just wanted to let you know that by using the full term of WordPress in the domain name, you are violating the WordPress trademark. http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/ I suggest switching your domain name to WP****** if possible or try obtaining permission to use the trademark in your domain name.</p>\n<p><strong>Response</strong> &#8211; Oh damn it, thanks for letting me know! I had no idea. I&#8217;ll see what I can do about changing the name. Kind regards,</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff</strong> &#8211; You&#8217;re welcome. Tons of people make the same mistake. Sorry you have to go about changing the domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Response</strong> &#8211; I looked into it yesterday and yeah, I really (bad word) up here. I bought the domain wp***** and migrated the whole site there, I&#8217;ll be 301 redirecting the whole site today. I&#8217;m sorry if I caused any bad feelings about my venture, just trying to make a living helping others with the CMS I love. I&#8217;ll be changing my email too in the next couple of days. Thanks for reaching out and letting me know so I could change the domain. I really appreciate it.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff</strong> &#8211; Nope, no bad feelings caused. I usually send out a friendly email to anyone violating the trademark as it&#8217;s best to deal with it early versus having that domain be established. You should be all set to go now. Good luck with your service. Oh, as a sidenote. I would look for any where you wrote Word(lowercase p)ress on the site and change it to WordPress as that&#8217;s the correct way to write it. It&#8217;s one of those weird prickly points the community has.</p>\n<p><strong>Response </strong>- Hi, Yeah, I found the discussion on Twitter, it seemed to cause a big stir among some. Saw some guy called me a douche for missing the capital P so I&#8217;ve changed it already. Thanks</p>\n<p>A couple of reasons why I published our email exchange. The first is to show that sometimes, people have good intentions but make an honest mistake. They didn&#8217;t know about the domain policy and rushed to change things to make it right. The established people in the WordPress community know about these guidelines and instead of chastising those site owners, we should first reach out to them via email or some other method to at least give them an opportunity to make things right. <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffr0/status/357576328234549250" title="https://twitter.com/jeffr0/status/357576328234549250">I started the Twitter dialogue</a> by mentioning how disappointed I was to see brand new WordPress services launch that violated the WordPress trademark. On Twitter, it&#8217;s too easy to fire off text that would be better off never being published. I&#8217;ve said a few things in the past I regret as have others. Let&#8217;s try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt before performing regretful actions. </p>\n<p>If you see anyone violating the WordPress trademark via by domain or other means, please try reaching that person via email or getting in touch with them any way possible to let them know. It could just be an honest mistake.</p>\n<p>I almost feel like these two articles need to be appended to every post ever written about WordPress.

We&#8217;ve made it through another week of widgets, fields, posts and plugins. It&#8217;s time to unwind with another installment of The Daily Plugin. We&#8217;ve got some really shiny new plugins to look at today in addition to some recent updates. The plugins listed represent a mere sampling of the most recently updated and newly released plugins from the WordPress Plugin Repository. Keep in mind that these plugins, like any plugin, should be tested on a staging site first to make sure that it works with your particular project parameters. Some plugins don&#8217;t work well with certain themes or other plugins. It&#8217;s always smart to test first to make sure all the plugins are working well together and performing as you expect them all to in harmony. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/suggest-review/assets/screenshot-2.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Suggest Review WordPress Plugin" src="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/suggest-review/assets/screenshot-2.png?resize=218%2C24" /></a><a title="Suggest Review WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/suggest-review/" target="_blank">Suggest Review</a> encourages users of the site to raise awareness of suspect or inaccurate content that may already be published to the site. It provides the viewer the opportunity to &#8220;flag&#8221; content and write a note to the administrator explaining the nature of their alert. I like the nature of the &#8220;suggestion&#8221; as it is done as a privately submitted form rather than out in public full view. The simple fact that this is a constructive mechanism for content revision, as opposed to the &#8220;comment trolls&#8221; is a welcome relief. There are safeguards in place that can restrict who sees or can submit to the &#8220;suggest review&#8221; button and functions. You can limit it to registered users so that the public or spammers are not pounding the system with false posts.</p>\n<p><a title="Microblog Poster WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/microblog-poster/" target="_blank">Microblog Poster</a> promises the ability to cross-post your newest content to multiple social sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, Plurk, Diigo and Delicious. While I am still testing this on my staging sites, I can report that so far I&#8217;ve run into nothing but success. There are very few plugins out there that integrate with LinkedIn properly. Microblog Poster handled all my posts with relative ease. While I use other plugins to handle my Twitter and Facebook notifications, this one will make a favorable addition to many of the WordPress sites that I frequently update content in. I anticipate that the developer will add more social sites as they become available as well.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/insert-estimated-reading-time/screenshot-1.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Insert Estimated Reading Time" src="http://i1.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/insert-estimated-reading-time/screenshot-1.png?resize=119%2C90" /></a><a title="Insert Estimated Reading Time WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-estimated-reading-time/" target="_blank">Insert Estimated Reading Time</a> helps to list an approximate reading time to your posts. The time calculation is based on a variable that you enter in the plugin&#8217;s settings screen. You have the option of displaying minutes or minutes/seconds in the display, as well as the template used, i.e. &#8220;This article will around XX minutes to read. Make sure you have a full beer before beginning.&#8221;. Quite a handy gadget to have at the start of your posts, especially if you tend to post a lot of lengthy content.</p>\n<p><a title="Comment CaVa WordPress Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/commentcava/" target="_blank">CommentCaVa</a> sets a virtual timer on your posts before a reader is allowed to make a comment. The concept is unique in that it forces the viewer to actually read the content first before they can comment. I&#8217;m not sure of the anti-spam implications of this plugin, but it may stop the flow on that end as well. It works within the native WordPress commenting system by installing a small JavaScript containing the timer elements. This is a new plugin with a developer that&#8217;s hungry to grow the functionality of the plugin, so please join <a title="Wordpress Profile for WortWart" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/wortwart/" target="_blank">WortWart</a> in making this plugin something that we can all use to extend on-page time of our readership.</p>\n<p>Well another week of The Daily Plugin is in the books. This weekend I&#8217;ll be taking it easy and hitting some outdoor events with my lovely wife. I&#8217;ll be back on Monday with a bit of a surprise for all of you Daily Plugin fans out there that have a commute. You can follow me on Twitter <a title="Marcus Couch on Twitter" href="https://twitter.com/marcuscouch">@marcuscouch</a> or leave your feedback right here on <a title="The Daily Plugin for 7-19-2013" href="http://wptavern.com/the-daily-plugin-for-07-19-2013">WPTavern.com</a>.

It&#8217;s already Thursday and The Daily Plugin has yet to find that perfect plugin that you&#8217;ve been &#8220;<em>Repository Diving</em>&#8221; for all week-long. Well today is your lucky day my friend. Not because we may have found that hidden gem you&#8217;ve been on the hunt for, but because we saved you at least one day of having to look for it yourself. It&#8217;s a dirty job, but someone has to do it. Remember to prevent your own sites from becoming a cesspool of non-functioning calamity, always test these plugins on a staging site. You never know what kind of damage new plugins can do to a site without proper evaluation and investigation. Even the smallest function of a plugin can turn a site and its theme completely upside-down. Also, let&#8217;s remember that the plugins that follow are merely a sampling of the newest and most recently updated plugins found in the WordPress Plugin Repository. They are not endorsed in any official capacity. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/mozscape/assets/screenshot-1.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="MOZ Analytics" src="http://i1.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/mozscape/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=175%2C93" /></a><a title="MozScape Plugin" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/mozscape/" target="_blank">Mozscape</a> is a recent release from the folks over at Moz (Formerly known as SEOMoz) that allows you to view analytical data from MozScape about the post you are currently editing. Data included in the analysis includes Moz Rank, MozTrust, page authority ranking, Total links (both internal and external) and anchor text metrics. This provides a great opportunity to analyze and re-optimize existing content on your site that you depend on for a constant flow of traffic. I&#8217;ve had great experiences using Moz in the past for analysis of client sites. It will be great to incorporate some of the same functionality directly into the WordPress content editor. Give it a shot if you have the least bit of curiosity as to how your writing style coördinates with what should be optimized in your content. You may be surprised to learn that with just a few minor edits and tweaks, you can get a page to rank quickly and keep it there. This is a free usage plugin, but it will require registration to Moz for an API key.</p>\n<p><a title="WP Welcome Message" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-welcome-message/" target="_blank">WP Welcome Message</a> displays an intro &#8220;<em>pop-up</em>&#8221; box for new visitors to your site. The content of the pop-up is created using a standard WordPress rich editor, allowing you to add any kind of content, HTML or short codes to your pop-up. The CSS elements conformed to my site with little challenge. This is a simple, easy way to add a brief introduction to yourself, talk about a special event or promotion, or any other need you see fit.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/automatic-post-date-filler/assets/screenshot-1.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Automatic Post Date Filler WordPress Plugin" src="http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/automatic-post-date-filler/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=184%2C100" /></a><a title="Automatic Post Date Filler" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-post-date-filler/" target="_blank">Automatic Post Date Filler</a> has a lot of intriguing uses, especially for someone like me who adds scheduled content to over 70 different WordPress installs on a monthly basis. The plugin works by setting a custom date and time for scheduled posts. Sort of like a smart playlist, it uses variables like &#8220;Current Date + X days&#8221; or &#8220;Time from the Furthest Scheduled Post + X Minutes&#8221; to determine how you would like the system to automatically schedule your next post. This is a fantastic &#8220;on deck&#8221; model to handle scheduled posts, making sure that all posts are as evenly spaced out as possible when published. It&#8217;s also great to prevent a mass post dump from happening all at once by automatically applying the scheduling limitation rules. It also provides an alternative button in your post editor, &#8220;Publish Immediately&#8221; which will override the scheduling filters and publish without any time alterations.</p>\n<p><a title="Better User Profile Fields" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-user-profile-fields/" target="_blank">Better User Profile Fields</a> is something that incorporates a multitude of Social networking profiles into the standard WordPress user profile including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Deviant Art and Tumblr. It can also use this data to populate different elements of your theme or content as well, simply by inserting PHP. For example, to add the Twitter profile URL of the user you would use <strong>get_author_meta(&#8216;twitter&#8217;)</strong>. Anyone who is a regular listener to <a title="Wordpress Plugins A-Z Podcast" href="http://wppluginsatoz.com">WordPress Plugins A-Z</a> knows that for years I have been screaming out for better usage of user profiles and the fields that we populate in them. This has all the elements to be a great plugin with a lot of great integration possibilities within themes and widgets. Something that has been lacking in WordPress for quite some time.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/wp-hashgrid/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=182%2C106"><img class="alignleft" alt="WP Hashgrid on Default WordPress theme" src="http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/wp-hashgrid/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=182%2C106" /></a><a title="WP Hashgrid" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-hashgrid/" target="_blank">WP Hashgrid</a> is a pure design and developer tool that acts as a grid overlay to your WordPress site. Implementing the hashgrid.js script to overlay a CSS-customizable grid, this plugin helps to keep things centered and in alignment. In the old days I used to print a grid on clear transparency sheets and tape them to the monitor for modifying and finalizing layouts. My, how far we&#8217;ve come!

security is one of those things in life I find fascinating. It&#8217;s a constant battle between good and evil. Just when the good guys think they have things figured out, the bad guys change their techniques. With all of the good that comes from using Cloud based services, there is also the other side of the coin. Cybersquared, a company dedicated to network and cyber security <a href="http://www.cybersquared.com/killing-with-a-borrowed-knife-chaining-core-cloud-service-profile-infrastructure-for-cyber-attacks/" title="http://www.cybersquared.com/killing-with-a-borrowed-knife-chaining-core-cloud-service-profile-infrastructure-for-cyber-attacks/">published a report with their findings</a> on how today&#8217;s attackers are using what they call, <a href="https://www.cybersquared.com/hiding-in-the-clouds/" title="https://www.cybersquared.com/hiding-in-the-clouds/">Service Profile Infrastructure</a> to facilitate command and control a.k.a. C2 phases of attack. </p>\n<p>In this report, it was highlighted that a Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat group used Dropbox and its file sharing notification feature to email links to targets that contained malicious binaries. This was considered phase 1 of the attack. Phase 2 worked with a WordPress.com hosted blog which acted as the command and control center. Once the malicious binaries were in use, the malware contacted the blog which hosted content that contained the IP address as well as the port number to receive commands from. </p>\n<p>Here is a screenshot from the WordPress.com account mentioned in the report. <del datetime="2013-07-18T15:49:25+00:00">The site is still online but I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s actively being used in malware attacks.

It would then read attacker staged content from within the blog posting to obtain a secondary domain, IP address and port number of a second stage C2 host.</p>\n<p>In this example at “gressered.wordpress[.]com”, we found multiple blog posts, all of which had likely served as content for specific targeting campaigns.  The same C2 configuration was “hiding in plain sight”. However, it is entirely possible that the attackers could have modified the second stage C2 configuration at any point previously. The earliest post was dated July 31, 2012, suggesting that this specific blog has been in use for nearly a year as a first stage interaction point.</p>\n<p>Many of the blog posts that contained the C2 configuration were associated with news articles related to geopolitical events, likely of interest to potential targets.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I can&#8217;t emphasize enough that <strong>no vulnerabilities in WordPress</strong> were used to carry out these attacks. This report shows that cloud services such as Dropbox and websites such as WordPress.com which are usually whitelisted are being used as infrastructure to carry out attacks.

Some of these items are highlighted below, and a full changelog for 1.8 is available <a href="http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/releases/version-1-8/">on the BP Codex</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Better theme integration</em></p>\n<p>Since BuddyPress 1.7, BP has been compatible with practically every WordPress theme. But traces of the BuddyPress Default theme were still everywhere to be seen, in particular concerning the way that buttons, fonts, and form elements were styled. In BuddyPress 1.8, we&#8217;ve made a thorough review of our stylesheets to make them more minimal &#8211; we call it a &#8220;de-theming&#8221; &#8211; so that BP inherits CSS styling more gracefully from the active WordPress theme. We&#8217;re thrilled with how seamlessly BuddyPress 1.8 integrates with a variety of WordPress themes, and we think you&#8217;ll be thrilled too.</p>\n<p><em>Template hierarchy</em></p>\n<p>One of the most powerful tools available to WordPress theme developers is <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy">template hierarchy</a>, which defines a set of file naming conventions for context-specific template overrides. BP 1.8 extends this concept to top-level BuddyPress templates &#8211; the templates that are first located when loading a BuddyPress page. Let&#8217;s say, for instance, that you want your Groups directory to have a single-column layout, while the rest of your BuddyPress content has a right-hand sidebar. Simply create a single-column page template in your theme at <code>buddypress/groups/index-directory.php</code>, and BuddyPress will use this file, instead of the fallback <code>page.php</code>, when loading the Groups directory.

While the BuddyPress team doesn&#8217;t like to make anyone wait (the 1.8 dev cycle has been our shortest ever, with every milestone hit right on schedule), we <em>do</em> like to think that we bring passion and care to BuddyPress that&#8217;s similar to Dom DeMarco&#8217;s single-minded pizza-making. So, we&#8217;re proud to name BuddyPress 1.8 &#8220;Di Fara&#8221; after Dom&#8217;s classic pizza joint.</p>\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n<p>As always, the BP core team extends appreciation to the scores of developers, designers, and community volunteers who have spent thousands of hours on this version of BuddyPress.

The website has been around for a long time. In fact, in just 10 days, the site will be celebrating its 6th birthday on July 27th. Created by Mark Ghosh in 2007, the site aimed to be the primary location for employers looking for professional WordPress help. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPJobsSite.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPJobsSite.jpg?resize=500%2C262" alt="WP Jobs Website" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7986" /></a></p>\n<blockquote><p>The site is intended to be used as the primary location for employers looking for professional WordPress help to post their needs and for WordPress professionals to find, apply for and obtain jobs in WordPress. We have focused on aesthetics, ease of use and consolidation of resources in developing WordPress Jobs. Feeds are available for every job category to make it easy for job seekers to find and apply for the right jobs as quickly as possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matt had a hand in getting the site launched in 2007. Coming around full-circle, Matt has the opportunity to once again continue the legacy that is the original Jobs.WordPress.Net website. As <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/meta/2013/07/17/seeking-2-moderators-for-jobs-wordpress-net/" title="http://make.wordpress.org/meta/2013/07/17/seeking-2-moderators-for-jobs-wordpress-net/">announced on the Make.WordPress.org website</a>, there has been a call for volunteer moderators for the website. The jobs board is still a popular destination but the amount of work required for one individual is daunting. The post outlines what is involved with the moderation process and the type of skills necessary to complete the work. It&#8217;s very encouraging to see that a number of people have already stepped up to help moderate this new community resource. </p>\n<p>On a WordPress jobs related note, PostStat.us just published their Summer edition of <a href="http://poststat.us/whos-hiring-in-wordpress-summer-edition/" title="http://poststat.us/whos-hiring-in-wordpress-summer-edition/">Who&#8217;s Hiring In WordPress</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/rvPCII3G3WU" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 16:39:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"WPTavern: The Daily Plugin for 07-17-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7958";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/ZJ6X6SqnVx0/the-daily-plugin-for-07-17-2013";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8046:"<p>We start early in the morning every day. Like the farmer extracting fresh eggs from his trusted hens, we&#8217;re up at the crack of dawn to examine the quality of each new plugin submitted to the WordPress Plugin Repository. Some are Grade A Extra Large, some are just a cracked shell with nothing inside. Either way, let&#8217;s get cracking and whip up today&#8217;s Daily Plugin Omelette. Remember that not all plugins play well with others. Make sure you test them on a secondary staging site before you take anything to a live site. We preach it, we live it. Follow our example and you&#8217;ll be thankful. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a title="First Google Map" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/first-google-map/" target="_blank">First Google Map</a> employs one of my favorite slogans, &#8220;Keep It Simple&#8221;. Often times when we&#8217;re trying to insert a simple Google map, the plugins or embed code we use is too bloated, doesn&#8217;t display titles correctly or are too difficult to set up ahead of time. In comes &#8220;First Google Map&#8221; that allows you to insert a plain language formatted address to display your Google Map. The shortcode is rather simple and uses common sense taxonomy in its options. For example, if you wanted to show Mr. Mullenweg&#8217;s new rumored Tony Stark style mansion location, simply enter: [googlemap title=''Matt''s Beachfront Cottage'' width=450 height=300 zoom=14]31250 Broad Beach Rd, Malibu, CA[/googlemap] and the map will embed inline in your content area with appropriate overlay title of your choosing. Pretty nice way to insert on the fly. I could not find a direct option to choose the &#8220;satellite&#8221; view option over the standard road-only mode, which was the only real drawback. Other than that, it would be nice to have more control over the size of the address font that overlays the map. Most addresses that I tried were hyphenated by the plugin because the font was too large and it flowed into the next line. Control over these elements would be great, even if just another call-out function from within the shortcode.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wp-chart-generator.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7960" alt="Wp-chart-generator sample output" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wp-chart-generator.jpg?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="WP Chart Generator" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-chart-generator/" target="_blank">WP Chart Generator</a> helps to embed an on-the fly 3D pie chart with multiple options, an automatic key and a nice hover dialogue that highlights each section when the user moves their mouse over the graph. The developer may need assistance converting this to English, as it&#8217;s completely in French. Fortunately, it&#8217;s so easy to use that the language barrier really didn&#8217;t make much difference. The shortcode is pretty easy to create within the plugin options, which allows you to copy the correct shortcode to embed within your posts. In the past I&#8217;ve used Google chart API callouts for embedding simple graphs, but for pie charts, this one takes the cake!</p>\n<p><a title="GSpeech" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/gspeech/" target="_blank">GSpeech</a> is a text to speech plugin that uses Google to read selected text aloud. At first I thought it would be just one of those &#8220;Type Something in the box and I&#8217;ll read it&#8221; type of plugins. I was sorely inaccurate. This plugin can incorporate full speech to read when certain scenarios occur, such as hovering over a tab to hear the tab&#8217;s navigation title read out loud. There are also hover-on, hover-off possibilities as well. When a site visitor hovers over the &#8220;about us&#8221; page, perhaps it can just start reading your bio aloud. It&#8217;s an interesting plugin for serving those with eyesight disabilities, but also an ideal educational platform as well. It may be used in combination with a gallery for a &#8220;storybook&#8221; type presentation. Even job training could be utilized using this kind of plugin to read instructions out loud. Great effort from those at <a title="2Glux" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/2glux/" target="_blank">2Glux</a> who developed this.</p>\n<p><a title="I Recommend This" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/i-recommend-this/" target="_blank">I Recommend This</a> scales back our traditional feedback mechanism by removing comments and relying on a simple &#8220;like&#8221; system instead. Included in the plugin is widget functionality that can display the most popular &#8220;liked&#8221; posts. Cookies are also utilized to prevent abuse of users over-liking your posts. You have the option to not show all the ZERO likes that you may have on your post. Once you get a like, it starts displaying on the post. Nice way to hide all the goose eggs (zeroes) that will be blatantly mocking you while you or other users browse through your site. It&#8217;s a good alternative to some of the mainstream Twitter/FB likes or the standard thumbs up / thumbs down ratings plugins that are out there. The developer <a title="Dreams Media" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/dreamsmedia/" target="_blank">Dreams Media</a> really thought it through with IP logging and Cookie tracking to prevent abuse. Additionally you can remove the IP logging to save system resources. Worth a try if you want to keep a fully enclosed like system to replace comments. Good for business sites that may not want to allow commenting, yet show a favorable presentation that someone out there likes their content. Great recently updated plugin.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-easy-albums-photos-video-and-music-next-gen/screenshot-4.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft" alt="Easy Albums for BuddyPress" src="http://i2.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-easy-albums-photos-video-and-music-next-gen/screenshot-4.jpg?resize=180%2C178" /></a><a title="Easy Albums for BuddyPress" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-easy-albums-photos-video-and-music-next-gen/" target="_blank">Easy Albums</a> is a new plugin for BuddyPress that allows the user base to upload their own audio files, playlists, images and videos to be displayed and organized in their own personalized albums. Not only does this allow a lot of media functionality from your user base, but it encourages commenting from other users as well. From an activity stream perspective, each user&#8217;s new media posts are shown within the timeline. While I love the functionality and flexibility that this all provides, the problem with this plugin from my perspective is that is requires a login from a third-party hosting server that the media is uploaded to. It is nearly perfect otherwise. A fully supported WPMU and Buddypress solution for full user media participation. Ideal for social and business applications of BuddyPress alike. If we could tie it to our own hosting or from Amazon or Dropbox without the additional login, I would gladly pay the developer <a title="Itaynoy" href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/itaynoy/" target="_blank">Itaynoy</a> a premium for it.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all the eggs in the basket for now.

This is a recommended upgrade for all customers.</p>\n<p><a href="http://crowdfavorite.com/news/2013/07/introducing-the-ramp-post-id-meta-translation-plugin/">We also released</a> the <a href="https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-ramp-postid-meta-translation">RAMP Post ID Meta Translation plugin (hosted on GitHub)</a> that should make RAMP even more useful for more complex sites. It gives you the ability to designate certain custom fields (by key) to be treated as post IDs and translated as part of the RAMP deploy process.</p>\n<p>This means if you have a plugin that is storing a post ID as post meta to indicate a relationship, or perhaps an additional image (attachment) ID as post meta, those can now be properly converted to point to the content deployed to your production site. This was probably the top requested feature for RAMP, so I&#8217;m thrilled to be able to make it available.</p>\n<p class="threads-post-notice">This post is part of the project: <a href="http://alexking.org/project/ramp">RAMP</a>.

title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/16/migration-update-wxr-importer/">published an update</a> on his progress working with the WXR Importer. In this update, Frederick will begin the process of updating the WordPress WXR Importer plugin.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve also run the unit tests that apply to the importer plugin; however, the test cases are generally small (indeed, the biggest XML test case is 26 KB, titled small-export.xml) and don’t trigger the kinds of issues that importing dozens or hundreds of posts and attachments—with WXR files of megabytes in size—does.</p>\n<p>So, the first task at hand is breaking up the process—which currently executes in one step with little indication of progress—into discrete chunks that can run in separate, stateful (stepwise) requests.</p>\n<p>A chat with my mentors has pointed me in the direction of WP_Importer_Cron, which was first developed for other importers that need to make external API calls (e.g. Tumblr Importer) potentially subject to rate constraints. There are some parallels between “external API calls” and “remote attachment fetching”, which is why this can be a suitable approach for fixing the timeout issues that present with the current WordPress importer. After the process is discretized, showing progress (an enhancement long overdue) will be easier.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m stoked to see Frederick not only concentrating on the functionality of the importer but also paying attention to the visual details such as showing import progress. There are a lot of eyeballs keeping track of this plugin hoping that Frederick&#8217;s work will pay off in an importer that does what it&#8217;s supposed to with minimal problems. I want to remind Frederick that if you need people to beta test your work, especially in the area of large export/imports, just say so.

In the interview, we learn the origin of his nickname Otto. However, I think one of the most interesting points in the interview are Otto&#8217;s thoughts on plugins. </p>\n<blockquote><p>If I have 100 plugins all doing their own thing, and I just combine them all into one file somewhere, then the code remains the same and there’s no advantages in doing so. Having them separate, with their own names, and their own descriptions, provides a way to keep track of things. I use snippets a lot too, but I put each snippet into its own plugin, for simplicity of management.</p>\n<p>The number of plugins doesn’t matter, the code is what matters, and where that code lives is unimportant. WordPress itself implements a lot of its own internal functionality in the same way a plugin would do so.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His response has been very consistent over the years. In 2011, he pretty much <a href="http://wpcandy.com/thinks/active-plugin-counts-just-dont-matter/#comment-198719" title="http://wpcandy.com/thinks/active-plugin-counts-just-dont-matter/#comment-198719">provided the same answer</a> when Ryan Imel of WPCandy published an article about the same topic. I also chimed in on this topic in 2011 where I discussed <a href="http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-quality-not-plugin-quantity" title="http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-quality-not-plugin-quantity">Plugin Quality, not Plugin Quantity</a>. This is one of those things in the world of WordPress that I&#8217;ve seen change over the past few years. The line of thought used to be that you could only run so many plugins before you ran into problems or, you shouldn&#8217;t run more than a certain amount.

If a project has a strong open source development community, an attempt to close it down should result in a fork of the project. As it happens, Movable Type Open Source was already forked.

Among the domain registration options are GoDaddy, NameCheap, and WordPress.com. The domain search also checks to see if that name is available on Twitter. When you click on the WordPress.com option, the domain field will automatically be filled in with that domain name. </p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SuperTavern.jpg" rel="thumbnail"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SuperTavern.jpg?resize=407%2C278" alt="Super Tavern" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7931" /></a></p>\n<p>Thanks to the acquisition, the <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/register-domain/" title="http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/register-domain/">following WordPress.com support page</a> will need to be updated to explain how to use the newly acquired services to search for available names. </p>\n<p>Congratulations to Matt Mazur on being acqui-hired and becoming yet another Matt that is employed by Automattic.

The guide covers user roles and suggests numerous plugins to make it easier to collaborate. With the recent addition of Marcus Couch to this website, it&#8217;s the first time in the history of WPTavern that I&#8217;ve had more than one author contributing articles on a regular basis. </p>\n<p>This multiple author section of WordPress is a whole new world for me and one I&#8217;m interested in learning about. Based on the post from WPKube, I plan on trying out the following plugins: <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-author-bio/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-author-bio/">Better Author Bio</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-status-notifier/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-status-notifier/">WP Status Notifier</a>, and possibly <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/edit-flow/">Edit Flow</a> although at this stage, Edit Flow seems to be too much of what I don&#8217;t need with just one other contributor to the site. There is one other plugin I may experiment with called <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors-plus/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/co-authors-plus/">Co-Authors Plus</a>. It allows me to assign an author to a post without having to create an additional user account. </p>\n<p><strong>What plugins do you use to make working with multiple authors easier?</strong></p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/0IxUcSBfgQc" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 20:21:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WordPress.tv: Brent Toderash: Finding the Right WordPress Plugin";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=20169";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/15/brent-toderash-finding-the-right-wordpress-plugin/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:678:"<div id="v-BbT5MxHY-1" class="video-player">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/20169/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/20169/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=20169&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/15/brent-toderash-finding-the-right-wordpress-plugin/"><img alt="Brent Toderash: Finding the Right WordPress Plugin" src="http://videos.videopress.com/BbT5MxHY/video-7f2e5fd1c6_std.original.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 19:25:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Alex King: My Content-Powered Projects Page";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://alexking.org/?p=17747";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"http://alexking.org/blog/2013/07/15/content-powered-projects-page";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7147:".threads-post-notice {\n	background: #e8e8e8;\n	padding: 10px;\n}\n.threads-post-notice a {\n	font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n<p>As <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/2013/07/07/reorganizing">alluded to earlier</a>, I&#8217;ve cleaned up my <a href="http://alexking.org/projects">projects page</a> which is now powered by a new taxonomy, custom post type and the content I&#8217;ve generated here over the last decade plus.

Create a Projects Taxonomy (and Post Type)</h3>\n<p>I created two new taxonomies to power the Projects page.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Projects: the names of my various projects.</li>\n<li>Project Groups: to group my projects into buckets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991273">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>I then used the <a href="http://crowdfavorite.com">Crowd Favorite</a> <a href="https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-tax-post-binding">taxonomy-to-post binding plugin</a> plugin to create a Project post type that is effectively a child of the Projects taxonomy. This way I will be able to add content, terms, featured images, etc. to my projects (in a very forward compatible way).</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991284">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<h3>2. Convert existing Categories and Threads to Projects</h3>\n<p>In my existing content structures I had both categories and <a href="http://alexking.org/project/threads">threads</a> that were dedicated to specific projects. I needed to convert those relationships to the new projects taxonomy I&#8217;d created.</p>\n<p>Changing the categories was straightforward, but there was a little more work for the threads because I needed to convert the related post types as well. I did separate SQL queries to get the various category and thread ids I needed to convert.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991297">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>Once everything was converted, I then ran a little code to save each term via the WordPress API so that the associated project post types content would be created (via the tax-post-binding library).</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991324">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>The existing terms are now fully converted to projects.</p>\n<h3>3. Create New Projects (with meta data)</h3>\n<p>Now that I had converted the existing categories and threads to projects, it was time to create the rest of the projects. I ended up creating a big array with lots of meta data so that I could run and test this locally, then replay it all on my live site.</p>\n<p>This code creates the new project groups taxonomy terms, the new project terms, and adds meta data to the associated project post types.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991315">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>I truncated that quite a bit as I inserted a <em>lot</em> of projects.</p>\n<h3>4. Assign Existing Posts to Projects</h3>\n<p>At this point we have all of our project terms and post types created, it&#8217;s time to use them.</p>\n<p>Finding the posts I wanted to put into each project wasn&#8217;t an exact science. I basically created a projects list, then did searches on my site to find the posts relevant to that project. Then I manually selected the post IDs for those posts, and put them into a big array.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991399">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t select the posts programatically because there&#8217;s a bit more nuance to choosing what is and isn&#8217;t applicable to a project than just a keyword search.</p>\n<p>As part of that process, I also added a &#8220;Projects&#8221; category to all of these posts. I use this to show links to the latest posts across all projects on the new page. I needed to add this category to all of the converted categories and threads too.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991415">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<h3>5. Expose the New Data to Create the Projects Page</h3>\n<p>With all of my data set up, the last step was to expose it to power the projects page. I decided to do this by creating a shortcode that would output the projects by group.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href="https://gist.github.com/5991434">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>This has a bit too much of a mix of template and presentation for my liking, but it works and refactoring it is pretty low on my list at this point. Next time I mess with that code, I&#8217;ll probably clean it up a bit.</p>\n<h3>6. Project Page</h3>\n<p>The final step in the process was to customize the output of the individual project page. I am outputting the description, related links and featured image from the bound post type, and I converted some of my Threads plugin code to show a timeline of posts in &#8220;newest first&#8221; order. I also added a &#8220;this post is part of a project&#8221; banner to the individual posts, again borrowing the code from the Threads plugin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://alexking.org/project/social">an example</a>.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I feel like the new <a href="http://alexking.org/projects">projects page</a> is a better representation of my projects, and will be more meaningful and maintainable in the future than the old static page was. It will also reward me for blogging more frequently by being more up to date as a result.</p>\n<p>All good things.</p>\n<div class="footnotes">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id="fn:1">\nMore on this in a future post.&#160;<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id="fn:2">\nI probably could have done this earlier in the process, but didn&#8217;t think of the feature I wanted it for until later.&#160;<a href="http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p class="threads-post-notice">This post is part of the thread: <a href="http://alexking.org/blog/thread/content">Content Presentation</a> &#8211; an ongoing story on this site.

This gets us one big step closer to getting 3.6 out in the wild. There is no link yet to the Post Formats UI plugin. I know many are hoping to see that come soon after 3.6 is released.

He recently <a href="http://danielespinoza.me/selling-plugins-to-get-out-of-debt/" title="http://danielespinoza.me/selling-plugins-to-get-out-of-debt/">published his personal quest</a> to conquer non-mortgage debt by selling his plugins. The debt amounted to $67,000 and he was able to pay it off in just 8 months. He is now creating an emergency fund equal to six months of income. But how did he conquer that monster the majority of us know as debt? He made the tough choice to sell two of the first plugins he ever developed despite them bringing in 4-5 thousand dollars in monthly recurring revenue. The plugins he sold were Authorize.net, AIM, and PayPal Express.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were sick and tired of our debt hindering us from being able to follow our passion of slow travel with our family as digital tentmakers. Our one goal became cleaning up our financial mess and removing that hurdle. So when we received the offer to sell we asked “Does this get us to our goal?” and the answer was “Yes.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Congratulations Daniel on beheading the monster that is debt. I hope your story serves as inspiration for many others to accomplish the same feat. </p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/KpDYhG6qWAE" height="1" width="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 02:54:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Jeffro";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"WPTavern: Week In WordPress Episode 5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7880";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/fFKmu2bWXUA/week-in-wordpress-episode-5";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1020:"<p>I invite you to watch <a title="http://slocumstudio.com/2013/07/week-in-wordpress-episode-5/" href="http://slocumstudio.com/2013/07/week-in-wordpress-episode-5/">Week In WordPress Episode 5</a> as yours truly and a group of WordPress faithful got together to discuss the news of the week.

Some people clip coupons, some collect stamps or dog trinkets. I dig through plugins. Lots of &#8216;em. The most mentionable are listed here in what we like to call The Daily Plugin. While I don&#8217;t consider this everyday offering to be a review, it&#8217;s certainly a spotlight on what plugins I feel the community can get the most usage out of. Your own circumstances and needs apply. Remember that these plugins are always to be tested on staging and development sites first as to not risk losing data or compromise speed or functionality when used in conjunction with your existing plugin set. OK, Let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a title="Similar Sites Menu" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/similar-sites-menu/" target="_blank">Similar Sites Menu</a> is an external sites &#8220;link menu&#8221; that acts as a secondary native menu in your top navigation bar. If you happen to run a sub domain or have sister sites this could be a really good option in which you can promote everything on the top-level. The theme that I tested this on did not play nice with the plugin when it came to CSS styling and matching the overall look and feel of my WordPress installation. However when I tested it on a secondary staging site they work great without any complications. I was able to edit the color scheme to match the site perfectly in just under three minutes. Any theme with a secondary menu could accomplish this task as well, but it&#8217;s nice to have another option when you need it.</p>\n<p><a title="Random Images" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/random-images/" target="_blank">Random Images</a> shows off the featured images within posts in a nice layout with uniformly sized thumbnails. When a thumbnail is clicked the plugin calls up a lightbox version of the enlarged image is shown with a link to the content item on top of the image. While I found that the functionality and overall design of this plugin was very appealing, the lightbox itself was not the result I was expecting. For the purposes of my own sites and content that resides within them, I would rather see this plugin serve the capacity in showing full post content rather than just images. I&#8217;m sure that this could be accomplished with just a bit of code revision, in addition to options of sharing the posts via social networking platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n<p><a title="TSP Featured Posts" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/tsp-featured-posts/" target="_blank">TSP Featured Posts</a> from The Software People gives you the opportunity to show off your posts in a simple Layout that can be easily managed and manipulated through shortcodes. After installing the plugin you make a determination as to your default thumbnail size and the length of the excerpt of the post that you&#8217;d like to display. Once all of those vital statistics have been entered into the system, you simply choose the category you&#8217;d like to display, how many posts you like, and the plugin does all the rest. This is a pretty good plugin for people who would like to tweak the themes without having to go through major code overhaul. There are certainly a number of themes that have this functionality built within the framework, but not all of them. I found this to be an excellent first entry from this particular developer and will be highlighting a few more plugins that they have released this week in the days that follow.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CSV-Test.png" rel="thumbnail"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7870" alt="CSV-Test" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CSV-Test.png?resize=150%2C150" /></a><a title="CSV to Sort Table" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/csv-to-sorttable/" target="_blank">CSV to SortTable</a> has been recently updated, and it&#8217;s turning into the kind of plugin that may have more usage than the developer even intended. The plugin functions by calling an external CSV file from a URL of your choosing and transforms it into a sortable HTML table. It&#8217;s simple to do on a per post basis in the form of an easy shortcode, such as <strong>[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv], </strong>showing the direct path to the file. There are other shortcode options as well, like hiding/showing the top or bottom rows, etc. I tested this on a few different CSV files with great success. The tables all looked great right out of the gate with little modification. So how does this plugin work and what can be expanded from it? Well I tried a few scenarios. The first thing that I did was try to make changes to an already uploaded CSV file to see if it would update on the fly. It did. So we know that it updates the file in real-time. This can be good and bad. Good because it always has the newest data. Bad because it&#8217;s always trying to download and convert that file on the fly. The load time wasn&#8217;t worth abandoning the plugin over, so I tried a few more &#8220;hacks&#8221; to see if I could expand the range even further. I took the same CSV file and saved it to a local dropbox folder. Then I went to the Dropbox site to get a private link to the csv file. This worked! I imported straight from Dropbox. The one issue I had is that I then went back and made a few changes to the file and re-saved in Dropbox. Even after editing and re-synching the folder, the new revisions did not &#8220;take&#8221; with the plugin. It could be a cache issue or something on the end of Dropbox, but it&#8217;s a good idea for the developer to think about using services like Google Drive and Dropbox to feed the CSV source path. I would love the ability to edit files on the fly and have them self-update into pricing or product tables in near real-time. It&#8217;s almost perfect and certainly works well as intended. It would be nice to connect a few more pipes to it though.</p>\n<p><a title="Buddypress XProfile Custom Fields Type" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-xprofile-custom-fields-type/" target="_blank">Buddypress Xprofile Custom Fields Type</a> helps to add more user functionality and community within your BuddyPress installation. It allows several custom fields to be used in reference to your users, such as the user&#8217;s birthday, email address, custom post type selector results, image fields, check box acceptances (for terms of service or rules acknowledgement) and other custom fields of your choosing. It also provides the user with the option to hide or show selected information on their user profile. All the fields work within the BP Profile Search plugin, so the information becomes completely searchable. I&#8217;m relatively new to BuddyPress, having created only a few small-scale private member sites. Any help that can come in the form of easy to configure fields and user options is always a welcome relief. If you are in the same boat that I am regarding editing and managing BuddyPress, you&#8217;ll appreciate the flexibility that this plugin provides.</p>\n<p>Thank you once again for joining me in another edition of The Daily Plugin.

INSERT INTO `wp_posts` VALUES(8, 2, '2013-03-08 06:39:46', '2013-03-08 06:39:46', '<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>\nPersonal injury cases can be complicated and you may have a lot of questions about your individual case. When you are preparing your personal injury claim, you will need to factor in the time lost from work, medical bills, and several other items to ensure you receive the best possible offer from insurance companies. Working with a personal injury lawyer can help you prepare your claim appropriately so you receive adequate compensation and are treated fairly. Below are some common questions that our clients ask; if you have a question that is not answered here, please contact the Law Office of David Azizi for your free, no obligation consultation.\n<h2><span style="color: #00456a">What is a personal injury?</span></h2>\nAny physical or mental injury caused by someone’s harmful acts or an act of negligence can be classified as a personal injury. Examples of personal injury include:\n\n• Car, truck and bus accidents\n• Motorcycle collision\n• Slip and fall accidents\n• Home accidents\n• Workplace accidents\n• Wrongful death\n• Defective product accidents\n<h2><span style="color: #00456a">How much do you charge for personal injury cases?</span></h2>\nWe do not charge any fees unless there is a settlement or until we recover all compensation on your behalf. Contact us as soon as possible so that we can provide you with immediate assistance for your case.\n<h2><span style="color: #00456a">Why should I use a personal injury lawyer?</span></h2>\nIf you have been injured physically or emotionally, you need the advice and guidance of a personal injury attorney to determine the total amount of compensation for your case. You have a right to receive compensation for someone else’s negligence, misconduct or other harmful acts. A personal injury attorney can help you aggressively pursue your case to recover any and all damages.\n\nCan I still file a personal injury claim if the accident was partly my fault? Yes. It is common for most accident victims to receive some compensation even if they contributed to the accident. In California, there is a rule of comparative negligence; this means that if you were 25% at fault for the accident, you can still collect 75% of the value for your case. Contact the Law Office of David Azizi so that we can assess your case.\n<h2><span style="color: #00456a">Do I need a personal injury lawyer if the insurance company offers a settlement?</span></h2>\nIt is in your best interest to consult with a personal injury attorney before accepting any type of settlement. Even if the insurance company is offering an attractive amount in the settlement, you may still be offered the lowest possible amount by the company; contact the Law Office of David Azizi to make sure you are being treated fairly and will be receiving adequate compensation for your particular case.\n<h2><span style="color: #00456a">What type of financial compensation can I receive from a personal injury claim?</span></h2>\nAny type of physical or mental pain or suffering you have endured can have both short and long-term implications. This means the extent of damages for your personal injury case may include both compensatory (actual) and punitive (criminal) damages. You may be eligible for financial compensation to cover damages such as:\n\nLoss of enjoyment\nEmbarrassment\nMental disability\nMedical bills\nLost wages\nPhysical disabilities\nProperty damage\nOut of pocket expenses\nEmotional trauma\nPermanent scars\nLoss of earning capacity\n<h2><span style="color: #00456a">If I want to look up the law myself, how can I do that?</span></h2>\nThere are several websites that provide free access to California law and the laws of other states. You can conduct your own research to learn more about your particular situation. However, working with a personal injury attorney that specializes in California cases can help you reach a decision about your next steps much faster.\n<h2><span style="color: #00456a">What is the statute of limitation in California for personal injury cases?</span></h2>\nFor adults, the personal injury case must be pursued within two years from the date of the injury. You must either settle the case or file a lawsuit to protect the statute of limitations. People under 18 years of age have until their 20th birthday to settle the case or file the lawsuit. Still, there are many exceptions to these rules. If the defendant in your case is a California governmental entity, an uninsured motorist, or if the accident occurred outside of the state of California, the rules and exceptions will vary significantly.\n<h2><span style="color: #00456a">If I don’t have health insurance, how can I get medical treatment for my injuries?</span></h2>\nThere are several health care providers in California that provide health care services on lien for our clients. They will wait for the final verdict of the case and settlement before getting paid. This is an attractive option for many of our clients, even if they have coverage with an HMO or PPO. Contact the Law Office of David Azizi so that we can assess your specific case.\n<h2><span style="color: #00456a">If I have injuries from participating in a sport, can I file a personal injury claim?</span></h2>\nIn most cases, you will not be able to file a personal injury claim. The State of California has a rule of law called the ‘assumption of the risk’ which prohibits recovery from the party that caused the injury during a sport-related accident. You should consult with an attorney to determine any provisions or exceptions to this rule.\n<h2><span style="color: #00456a">Why should I choose the Law Office of David Azizi to represent my case?</span></h2>\nWe specialize in litigating personal injury cases and have extensive experience in handling personal injury cases. We are always up-to-date on the latest rules, regulations and interpretations of California laws.

If the dog is particularly aggressive or dangerous, a muzzle may even be necessary whenever the dog is in public. If the owner fails to control the pet adequately and someone gets bitten, they can be responsible for the injuries and trauma the bite causes.\n\nThose who have been bitten by any animal first need to have the injury examined by a medical professional who can thoroughly cleanse and treat the wound. Not only does the wound need prompt and proper care, but there is always the possibility that the animal was diseased and passed the disease to the victim. A call to your doctor or emergency personnel should always be your first move, and you should make every effort to identify or locate the animal so that it can be checked for rabies or other diseases.\n\nAfter the injury has been treated by a medical professional, qualified and experienced legal assistance such as that available by an animal bite personal injury attorney at AziziPersonalInjury.com should be your next step if you wish to receive the highest possible compensation for your pain and suffering.

The most common types of spinal cord injuries include:\nHerniated disc injuries – also known as a bulging disc or ruptured disc, this type of spinal cord injury typically occurs when the small bone connected to the spine separates the human back bones and creates pressure on the spinal column. The effects of this type of injury include shoulder pain, leg pain and lower back pain.\nThoracic injuries – these injuries are sustained in the abdominal muscle area and result in paraplegia. This means the individual typically cannot move their legs or feet as a result of the violent impact to the spine.\nCentral cord syndrome - this is an incomplete spinal cord injury that results in the impairment of the arms and hands. The damage typically occurs in the upper regions of the spinal cord and often leads to extensive sensory loss.\n\nA spinal cord injury can be serious and even life threatening.

When that person is lost to us because of some person''s or group''s negligence, misconduct, or carelessness, our distress is even greater. Knowing that the death wasn''t necessary, that someone''s actions or inactions caused it, produces what is called a wrongful death.\n\nThe next of kin or surviving family may file a wrongful death lawsuit if they believe the death resulted from negligence, misconduct, or carelessness. Cases like this are tragically common and can arise from a variety of causes. Some of these include unnecessary exposure to harmful substances such as asbestos, reactions to Vioxx® and other medications, malpractice or other negligence on the part of medical professionals, automobile accidents that are caused by careless or reckless driving, including drunk drivers, and deaths that are caused by defective products that the manufacturer knew about or should have been aware of.\n\n<h3>What is Meant By “Wrongful Death?”</h3>\n\nA variety of cases and deaths can be considered as a wrongful death. In essence, a wrongful death is one that is unnecessary and that only occurred because of someone''s negligence, misconduct, carelessness, or by their actions. A wrongful death can come about instantly, such as during a motor vehicle accident, or slowly, like after exposure to asbestos.\n\n<h3>What Are Some Examples of Wrongful Death?</h3>\n\nRecently, there have been an increasing number of deaths from mesothelioma, a result of asbestos exposure. This exposure can result from manufacturers who can be shown to be negligent or from companies that fail to notify their workers about the presence of asbestos and do not provide adequate protection against it.\n\nAnd it isn''t just asbestos. People needlessly die after being exposed to Benzene. Exposure to the fumes that come from welding rods can also be a killer, and carelessness or negligence on the part of companies who make these products or groups who use them can also result in a wrongful death.\n\nDrug companies, too, can be liable for those who were killed by using their products, even if the product was used as directed. Merck, the manufacturer of Vioxx®, has been found responsible for deaths that came about because of side-effects of that drug, and other similar drugs have also been found to cause fatalities.\n\n<h3>What Can I Do If I Believe a Loved One Has Suffered a Wrongful Death?</h3>\n\nThose who remain after a family member has died from a wrongful death naturally feel frustrated and entitled to compensation. The loss of a loved one is always a very stressful time, and if that death was unnecessary and caused by others or another person, the feelings are even more pronounced. The death can create not only sadness and dismay, but serious financial consequences if the person who dies was the one whose income sustained the family.\n\nWhether the death resulted from exposure, a car accident, side effects from medicines, malpractice, or any one of a number of equally tragic conditions, the remaining members of the family may be entitled to receive compensation for their needless and drastic loss.\n\nIf you believe the death of a family member was the result of a wrongful death, you should contact AziziPersonalInjury.com for an experienced personal injury lawyer who can provide action equal to his caring. Expert, qualified legal representation and assistance can help you receive just compensation for your loss, and your taking that action helps overcome your sense of helplessness. An initial consultation where we can discuss your case, which we provide at no cost or obligation, will let you know if you have grounds for legal redress and compensation and how we can best provide assistance.\n\nOur experience with similar cases gives us an advantage over some other personal injury lawyers. We know how to build and present a solid case that will give you the highest possible settlement, one that includes acknowledgment of your grief, pain and suffering, and financial consequences.\n\nWe can make sure that your loss is not any greater than it needs to be and that your unnecessary and deep pain, anguish, and loss is acknowledged and fully addressed.

Following his injury, Plaintiff complained to his coaches about being fatigued and having head pain. Despite the signs of head injury, Defendant’s coaches told Plaintiff to continue playing in the football game instead of taking him out of the game. Defendants failed to have any medical personnel check Plaintiff until he was unconscious in the fourth quarter! After Plaintiff’s complaints at half time the coaching staff decided to only play Plaintiff on defense in the second half. Unfortunately, despite the coach’s admission that he thought Plaintiff should rest on offense in the second half of the game they nevertheless continued to play Plaintiff virtually every play at the second half until he collapsed.\n\nAt his deposition Plaintiff wrote down on a piece of paper that at half time although he informed his coaches about his head pain, the coaches “told him to play”. Plaintiff exhibited classic signs of brain trauma: headache, blurred vision, lethargy, bad memory, crossed eyes, dizziness and breathing problems.\n\nDefendant did not have a professional trainer or medical personnel available. Defendant’s coaches should have noticed Plaintiff’s problems but they were not properly trained or educated on brain trauma and ignored the initial signs of Plaintiff’s brain trauma. During the third quarter Plaintiff said he could no longer continue to play. The Defendant’s coaches finally recognized that Plaintiff was injured and called an injury time out. Although the Unified School District had medical personnel available, no medical aid was summoned at the time Plaintiff was taken out of the game. Defendant admitted when Plaintiff came out of the game in the 3rd quarter and being unable to continue, Plaintiff had complaints of head pain and blurred vision. The other players testified that Plaintiff was forgetting the plays and his eyes appeared to be crossing in his head. Despite overwhelming evidence of brain injury Plaintiff was simply placed on the bench to sit without any adult supervision. While on the bench Plaintiff had problems staying awake and keeping his head erect. While alone on the bench Plaintiff’s head slumped to his chest and he stopped breathing for several minutes. The medical personnel were summoned only after Plaintiff had stopped breathing.\n\nPlaintiff’s profound injuries were the result of the failure of Defendant’s employees to recognize obvious signs of concussion, the failure to promptly summon aid and/or their failure to render necessary medical care until it was too late.\n\nOne of Plaintiff’s experts, a highly qualified coaching expert, was of the opinion that: “[n]o trainer was present for the Unified School District players during the game. This was unreasonable and violated accepted guidelines for high school football games. It is unreasonable and below high school football community standards to have a six (6) man coaching staff and no medical personnel of any type looking out for the well being of the players. The “Minimal” safety considerations require that coaches receive education on brain trauma and be alert to the initial signs of such injuries. The Unified School District coaches were not adequately trained and ignored the initial signs of Plaintiff’s brain trauma....\n\nThe “Minimal safety considerations require that players who have complained of any head-related injury such as headaches, dizziness or disorientation, be closely monitored by trained adult supervision. Players who have been taken out of a game with possible head injuries are never left alone. Plaintiff was left alone and without trained adult supervision after he complained of head-related injuries. Defendant also failed to adequately educate the players on the risk of injury. According to Plaintiff’s expert, “The failure to instruct the players on what to do if they were injured on the field or what to do if they notice another player with signs of injury falls below the minimum community standards and requirements for a high school football coaches.”\n\nAnother one of Plaintiff’s expert a well qualified medical doctor, was of the opinion that Plaintiff was a normal, healthy young man before the game. However, because of the Defendant’s employees failure to recognize the early sings and symptoms of Traumatic Brain Injury and render prompt medical care, Plaintiff suffered permanent and profound massive brain injuries. “ the Unified School District should not have allowed Plaintiff to play at all after Plaintiff’s half time complaints.”\n\nOnce a person suffers a head injury, subsequent head trauma produces exponentially more severe injury to the underlying brain. Every additional hit Plaintiff took after half time, deleteriously effected Plaintiff’s chances at a meaningful recovery. After the initial insult, subsequent hits compounded the underlying brain damage. In the doctor’s opinion, “Plaintiff’s medical condition would not have deteriorated as it did if reasonable medical aid was rendered to him at half time or shortly thereafter and he would not have suffered profound brain damage had the Unified School District timely rendered medical aid.”\n\nAdditionally, when Plaintiff was taken out of the game during the third quarter he was simply told to sit on the sidelines without competent care. During this time, Plaintiff was nodding off and slumping forward. Slumping forward was a substantial factor in airway obstruction causing his breathing to stop, depriving Plaintiff’s brain of oxygen. According to Plaintiff’s doctor, “Had Plaintiff not been left alone and without competent care it was more probable than not to a reasonable medical certainty that his brain would not have been deprived of oxygen and he would have suffered less injuries from which he suffered.”\n\n\n\n* Results may vary depending on your particular facts and legal circumstances.

At the time of the incident, Plaintiff had only worked for his employer for 1 ½ weeks. His job was to operate a forklift to unload crates from trailers. Plaintiff had approximately 9 years experience working with forklifts loading and unloading products.\n\nOn the day of the incident a co-worker with more experience and seniority than Plaintiff, asked Plaintiff to assist him in unloading a pallet that he was having trouble with. Plaintiff went to the trailer and his co-employee instructed Plaintiff to stand next the load and use his hands raised above his head to stabilize the load as Plaintiff’s co-worker attempted to lift the load with the forklift. The load consisted of 24 boxes of steel coils. The load weighed 1600 pounds. As Plaintiff’s co-employee attempted to lift the pallet, the entire load fell crushing Plaintiff. As a result of the incident, Plaintiff was paralyzed.\n\nPlaintiff contented that the trailer had been improperly loaded. The method used violated all known industry standards. The trailer was loaded improperly from every conceivable consideration. The load was stacked four layers high. The highest layer was the heaviest layer. The load of 1600 pound coils should never have been placed on top of another load. Additionally, the load of coils was wider than the load directly below it making the load unstable. Worse yet, the third and fourth layers of products were placed on an extremely narrow and unstable second layer. It was essentially shaped like a reversed triangle with the heaviest load on the top. Additionally, the third layer, the one directly below the 1600 pound pallet of coils were long rows of narrow, loosely packed boxes of roof awnings. The lose boxes of roof awnings were not fastened together in any manner and, therefore slid about, shifting as the trailer moved in transport causing the 1600 pound load of coils to shift and move about the trailer haphazardly.\n\nThe last factor that made this catastrophic accident a virtual certainty was the manner in which the Defendant Company wrapped its load for transport. The 1600 pound boxes of coils were shrink wrapped together but never attached to the wood pallet. Industry standards require that the shrink wrap load must be attached to the pallet to prevent exactly the type of accident that occurred in this case. The load should have been shrink wrapped around the wood pallet and then steel banded together. Defendant Company was responsible for properly wrapping and securing its load before it was given to the Defendant for transport.\n\nPlaintiff suffered a T-12 fracture with neurological involvement. He was diagnosed as being an incomplete T-12 paraplegic. Sadly, Plaintiff suffered perhaps the worse spinal injury a person can suffer. He was paralyzed and wheelchair bound yet continued to experience severe back and lower extremity pain and he has no bowel or bladder control.\n\n\n\n* Results may vary depending on your particular facts and legal circumstances.

The Defendant Car Manufacturer became aware that most of its vehicles’ front seats would collapse or “yield” rearward in rear-end collisions as light as 15 to 20 mph.\n\nDefendant Car Manufacturer an alternative design which was a belt-integrated seat technology available which Defendant Car Manufacturer tested as early as the early 1970''s. The belted-integrated seat employed a restraint system built into the seat itself, providing protection against seat back failure rearward in a rear-end impact. A primary cause of seat back failure in modest speed rear-end impacts, is the existence of only a single recliner mechanism asymetrically mounted on the outboard side of the front seat. All of the strength of the seat in a rear-end impacts, must be borne by the single recliner during an impact when the front-seat occupant’s center of mass moves rearward against the seat back, the forces of which are usually beyond the structural load limits of the single recliner. One of Defendant Car Manufacturer’s own solutions to this problem was to have a dual-recliner seat design utilized in Defendant Car Manufacturer’s other vehicles, which Defendant Car Manufacturer admitted only costs Defendant Car Manufacturer only $4 to $6 more per vehicle.\n\nDefendant Car Manufacturer had amassed substantial evidence from a variety of sources that its seat back failures in rear-end impacts were the cause of substantial deaths and serious injuries. Moreover, despite Defendant Car Manufacturer had received its own dealer warranty claims database (MORS) and vehicle owner’s questionnaire (VOQ) which placed Defendant Car Manufacturer on notice about seat back failures, Defendant Car Manufacturer never investigated even a single one of the reported MORS and VOQ injuries involving failed front seat in rear-end impacts. In fact, one of Defendant Car Manufacturer’s engineers proposed an interim design standard which would have increased the seat back strength of Defendant Car Manufacturer’s vehicles to generally mirror those of the Europeans in order to prevent seat back failures, but Defendant Car Manufacturer buried its proposal and never implemented the design.\n\n\n* Results may vary depending on your particular facts and legal circumstances.

The impact threw Plaintiff approximately 30 feet.</span>\n\n<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Plaintiff contended that the intersection at question had been the subject of numerous prior complaints and eighteen reported accidents. The City’s internal records\nonly reflect eighteen prior accidents. However, the City’s records were fatally flawed. Numerous witnesses that worked adjacent to the subject accident have stated under\npenalty of perjury that there aware of approximately twelve accident every year and near misses occurring everyday. The Defendant’s records did not reflect any fatal accidents,\nhowever, independent investigation revealed at least three fatal accidents at the location.</span>\n\n<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The problem with the intersection was that the cross-walk was placed immediately after a “blind” corner. A driver traveling southbound on Abbot Kinney had only 165 feet of\ntravel from the time they see the intersection until the time they cross the intersection. The posted speed limit was 30 mph and most drivers travel at a speed in excess of 30 mph\nthrough this location. If you assume an average speed of 40 mph and a standard perception reaction time of 2.5 seconds, the intersection was fatally dangerous. The\naverage driver will travel approximately 150 feet if they break immediately upon seeing the crosswalk. If there was any hesitation, the pedestrian would be involved in a pedestrian\nvs car accident. The major problem was seeing the pedestrian in the crosswalk soon enough to begin braking. The speed and time ratios did not satisfy the City of Los Angeles’\nown internal standards for a safe crosswalk. Numerous letters were obtained in discovery from the City’s own files where citizens had written letters to warn the City the subject\nintersection was extremely dangerous and that people would be seriously hurt or killed if changes were not made. The city’s response was to paint a higher visibility crosswalk.\nThe visibility of the crosswalk had nothing to do with the blind corner and short lines of sight. The issue never was the inability see the painted lines of the crosswalk, the problem\nalways was the inability to perceive a person crossing the street within sufficient time to avoid an impact. Plaintiff contended that the City should have installed a flashing indicator\nto warn motorist prior to the corner when a pedestrian is in the crosswalk. This type of warning system was used throughout the adjacent City of Santa Monica with success. In\nfact blinking pedestrian warning signals were used successfully at numerous locations less than a mile from this one.</span>', 'Dangerous Cross-Walk Resulting In Pedestrian vs Car Accident', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'dangerous-cross-walk-resulting-in-pedestrian-vs-car-accident', '', '', '2013-05-24 03:28:53', '2013-05-24 03:28:53', '', 0, 'http://azizipersonalinjury.com/main/main/?p=362', 0, 'post', '', 0);

Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital\nheld that an employer is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within\nthe scope of the employment. Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, (1995)\n12 Cal. 4th 291, 296. The California Supreme Court further held that equally well\nestablished, is the principle that an employee''s willful, malicious and even criminal torts\nmay fall within the scope of his or her employment for purposes of respondeat superior,\neven though the employer has not authorized the employee to commit crimes or intentional\ntorts. Id. at 297.\n\nThe court in Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital held that while the\nemployee need not have intended to further the employer''s interests, the employer will be\nliable if there is a causal nexus to the employee''s work or if the act could have been\nforeseen by the employer. Id. at 297, 299. The “foreseeability” test is met if, in the context\nof the particular enterprise, the employee''s conduct is not so “unusual or startling” that it\nwould seem “unfair” to factor the liability into the employer''s cost of doing business. Id. at\n299.\n\nThe court in Lisa M. v. Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital held that\nforeseeability test is useful “because it reflects the central justification for respondeat\nsuperior [liability]: that losses fairly attributable to an enterprise-those which foreseeably\nresult from the conduct of the enterprise-should be allocated to the enterprise as a cost of\ndoing business.” Id. at 299.\n\nIn the case at hand, it was foreseeable that because Defendants hired an employee\nwith a criminal history of felonies, a person who was misrepresenting that he was a\nlicensed x-ray technician, that minor children would be at risk for inappropriate conduct if\nthey allowed such an employee to bring little boys alone into a dark, windowless x-ray\nroom. If the conduct was foreseeable under the totality of circumstances as set forth in the\ncases above, Defendant is 100% vicariously liable for the conduct of its employee.\n\nIf Defendant’s employee’s wrongful conduct falls outside the employment\nrelationship or scope of employment, thereby precluding respondeat superior liability, the\ninjured party may nevertheless be able to hold the employer directly liable on a theory of\nnegligent hiring and/or supervision. Liability for negligent hiring/supervision is based on the\ntheory that if an enterprise hires an incompetent or unfit employee with characteristics that\nmight pose a danger to persons the employee is expected to come into contact with in the\nemployment relationship (e.g., customers, other employees), the enterprise should bear\nthe loss caused by the employee''s wrongdoing. See Hawkins v. Wilton (2006) 144 CA4th\n936, 944, 51 CR3d 1, 6—“an employer cannot allow a drug-addled convicted felon to carry\nand brandish loaded firearms during the course and scope of employment, particularly\nwhere, as here, the employment necessarily consists of making contact with members of\nthe public.”\n\nLiability for negligent hiring and supervision is based upon the reasoning that if an\nenterprise hires individuals with characteristics which might pose a danger to customers\nor other employees, the enterprise should bear the loss caused by the wrongdoing of its\nincompetent or unfit employees. Mendoza, v. City of Los Angeles, (1998) 66 Cal. App. 4th\n1333, 1339. In California, an employer can be held liable for negligent hiring if he knows\nthe employee is unfit, or has reason to believe the employee is unfit or fails to use\nreasonable care to discover the employee''s unfitness before hiring him. (See 53 Am.\nJur.2d. Master and Servant, §422, pp. 436-437.)\n\nDefendant’s were negligent in the supervision of their business which directly led to\nthe molestation. Defendant’s employee took the minor child directly in front of the other\nstaff when he was not supposed to, to a place in the office he was not supposed to take\nanyone. Defendant’s employee walked the minor child through the office in “broad\ndaylight” so to say, into the x-ray developing room. The minor child was not supposed to\nbe taken to have x-rays and certainly not alone with a felon in an x-ray dark room. Also,\nDefendant’s employee right in front of Defendant’s other employees, prevented Plaintiff’s\nmother from accompanying him which should have put the other Defendants on notice of\nthe suspicious conduct of their employee.\n\nPlaintiff’s experts will testify that defendant’s had insufficient office policies and that\nno employee should be permitted to take minor children alone into private rooms.\n\nIn the case at hand, Defendants were negligent in hiring and supervision of their\nemployee. If Defendants exercised due care in selecting an employee, they would have\ndiscovered the fact that their employee had a criminal history of felonies and that he was\nmisrepresenting that he was licensed. Defendants then would have had reason to know\nthat their employee had character flaws that made him unsuitable and unsafe to be\nallowed to take small children into a dark room with no windows.', 'Sexual Molestation of a Minor Child', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'sexual-molestation-of-a-minor-child', '', '', '2013-05-24 03:35:08', '2013-05-24 03:35:08', '', 0, 'http://azizipersonalinjury.com/main/main/?p=376', 0, 'post', '', 0);

An inspection of the subject premises\nconducted under similar circumstances revealed that the measure of light for the subject\ndoorway and the parking lot was in the range of 0.06 to 0.13. The measure of lighting for\nthe subject doorway was only 0.06. However, on another inspection, the measure of light\nwas higher, because Defendant had installed light fixtures in the patio leading to the\nsubject doorway and rope lighting around the building.\n\nThe light measurements taken by Defendant’s expert revealed that the light source\nwas less than one (1) foot candle of lighting required by Uniform Building Code.

Defendant was aware that the security garage\ngate was broken and that it remained open. However, Defendant failed to take minimally\nburdensome measures of having the security gate repaired. Instead, Defendant arbitrarily\nat times would manually close the gate. Only after occurrence of this tragic incident,\nDefendant finally replaced the motor for the security garage gate and employed security\nguards.\nPrior to the subject incident, another tenant was robbed at gun point at the subject\nunderground garage. The tenants of the building had meetings with Defendant’s\nrepresentative wherein the tenants voiced their concern about the non-working security\ngarage gate allowing access to intruders. In particular, the tenants were concerned about\ntheir safety since the subject building was located in a very high crime area of Los Angeles\nplagued with rival street gangs (Blood and Crips). In fact, prior to the subject incident, the\nmanager of the building had been subject of a drive by shooting. Defendant knew or\nshould have known that the subject building was located in a gang neighborhood\nparticularly because there would be shots fired or heard around the subject building.\nAdditionally, circumstantial evidence of the fact that Defendant was aware that security\nmeasures were necessary for the subject building was established by the fact that during\nthe time period of 2000-2001, Defendant had employed security guards for the subject\nbuilding. Defendant had no explanation for why the security guards were not retained after\n2001.\nPlaintiffs relied upon Defendant since the subject apartment building was built to\nlook like a secure complex as an inducement to rent especially in high-crime neighborhood.\nThe subject building was considered to be a security building because the building was\nfenced in and access into the building would be only through locked gates. As stated\nabove, Defendant’s manager had a custom and practice to close the garage security gate\nby hand around 8:00p.m. However, on May 23, 2005, the manager failed to close and lock\nthe garage security gate at 8:00p.m. or arrange for anyone else to do so.\nOn May 23, 2005, at approximately 1:00 a.m., Plaintiffs were hanging out in the\nunderground parking of Defendant’s building in Los Angeles, California.

Once the SUV entered the parking, the driver passed the\nPlaintiffs and made a turn in the parking garage driving back towards the open security\ngarage gate wherein the passengers within the SUV started to shoot at Plaintiffs at close\nrange with nine (9) mm guns. The suspects then fled the scene by driving out of the\nunsecured garage. The suspects were not tenants of the subject building. Because the\ngarage security gate was standing open at 1:00a.m., plaintiffs’ assailants were able to drive\ntheir black SUV vehicle into the garage and shoot Plaintiffs multiple times.\n"Out of the generic obligations owed by landowners to maintain property in a\nreasonably safe condition, the law of negligence in the landlord-tenant context has evolved\nto impose a duty of reasonable care on the owner of an apartment building to protect its\ntenants from foreseeable third party criminal assaults." Castaneda, v. Olsher, (2005) 132\nCal. App. 4th 627.\nOrdinarily, there is no duty to protect others from third party criminal activity.\nTarasoff v. Regents of University of California (1976) 17 Cal. 3d 425, 435. However,\ncourts, “have recognized exceptions to the general no-duty-to-protect rule” one of which\nis the “special relationship’ doctrine.” Delgado v. Trax Bar &amp; Grill (2005) 36 Cal.4th 224,\n235. “Courts have found such a special relationship in cases involving the relationship\nbetween business proprietors such as shopping centers, restaurants, and bars, and their\ntenants, patrons, or invitees.” Id. Based on the special relationship, “commercial\nproprietors ... are required to ‘maintain land in their possession and control in a reasonably\nsafe condition’ and ... this general duty includes taking ‘reasonable steps to secure\ncommon areas against foreseeable criminal acts of third parties that are likely to occur in\nthe absence of such precautionary measures.” Id. at 237.\nIn the case at hand, Defendant’s property was appropriately designed as a secure\ncomplex, considering the hostile neighborhood, with perimeter fencing on all sides and selfclosing\nand self-locking gates and doors. According to Defendant, all doors and gates\nincluding the garage motorized security gate were supposed to be closed and locked at all\ntimes. A remote control, issued only to tenants, was required to open the garage security\ngate. This garage security gate was designed to self-close and lock automatically after an\nauthorized vehicle entered.\nThe garage security gate for Defendant’s building at issue began to malfunction at\nleast a month prior to this shooting incident. Fame Gardens resident manager admitted to\nknowing that the garage security gate would not automatically close or lock. However,\nrather than properly repair the defective gate motor, Defendant would sometimes leave the\ngarage security gate standing open including the night plaintiffs were shot.\nThe court in Ambriz v. Kelegian 146 Cal. App.4th 1519, 1534, held that requiring\na landlord to maintain doors and locks in good working order places a minimal burden on\nthe landlord, particularly considering the fact that the landlord originally installed the locks\nand gates, presumably to maintain controlled and limited access to the property. Because\nrequiring a landlord to use, maintain and/or repair already existing doors and locks imposes\nonly a minimal burden on the landlord, the degree of foreseeability required need not be\nas great as that required in Sharon P. or Ann M. The court in Ambriz concluded that the\n[plaintiff] needed to show only “regular reasonable foreseeability” to establish the existence\nof such minimal duties.\nIn circumstances in which the burden of preventing future harm caused by third\nparty criminal conduct is great or onerous ... heightened foreseeability-shown by prior\nsimilar criminal incidents or other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of violent\ncriminal assaults in that location-will be required. By contrast, in cases in which harm can\nbe prevented by simple means or by imposing merely minimal burdens, only ‘regular’\nreasonable foreseeability as opposed to heightened foreseeability is required.” Delgado,\nId. at 243-244, fn. 24.\nDefendant had 81 units for rent. It was obligated to rent to low and very-low income\ntenants. Defendant’s apartment was located in a very-high crime area of Los Angeles\nplagued with rival street-gangs (Blood and Crips). According to testimony and police\nrecords, Defendant’s tenants and a manager had suffered from prior violent criminal\nincidents including numerous robberies, assaults with a deadly weapon, batteries, and\nshots fired between 2000 and 2005. There was testimony of a prior robbery inside the\ngarage. Defendant’s management had actual notice that violent crime was highlyforeseeable\nand that a strong security plan was necessary to prevent harm. This high level\nof crime foreseeability created a duty for Defendant to warn tenants and invitees of the\nimpending danger, and provide adequate security.\nThe Delgado court also reiterated that a plaintiff can establish the heightened\ndegree of foreseeability necessary to impose a duty to take additional burdensome security\nmeasures such as hiring security guards not only by presenting evidence of prior similar\ncriminal incidents occurring on the property, but also, in the alternative, by presenting\nevidence of "other indications of a reasonably foreseeable risk of violent criminal assaults\nin that location...." Delgado, at 239 (italics added.)\nExpounding on the significance of the phrase "or other indications of a reasonably\nforeseeable risk of violent criminal assaults in that location" as used in Sharon P., the\nDelgado court explained: "The disjunctive phrase was employed to acknowledge that,\neven in the absence of evidence of prior similar crimes on the defendant''s premises, other\ncircumstances--for example, similar violent crime occurring on the premises of a nearby\nand substantially similar business establishment [citation]--might provide the requisite\nheightened degree of foreseeability." Delgado, at 240, fn. 19.\nDelgado held that a defendant''s duty “is premised upon the danger that the\ndefendant knows or reasonably should anticipate, and that the defendant''s duty is simply\nto take reasonable steps in light of those circumstances.” Id. 247. The court also held that\nas a matter of logic, it is difficult to understand how the existence or scope of a proprietor''s\nduty properly could depend upon the nature of the criminal conduct “that actually occurred,”\nrather than the danger of which the defendant was or should have been aware. Id.\nPrior to May 23, 2005, the owners and managers of Defendant failed in their duty\nto reasonably assess the foreseeable security risk in the common areas and implement\nan adequate security plan based on the nature of the premises, the crime demographics,\nand the location. Defendant’s apartment was located in Southwest Division as designated\nby Los Angeles Police Department. The Southwest Division has long been considered one\nof the most dangerous areas in the city and a stronghold of rival Blood and Crip gangs.\nDefendant’s manager and supervisor surprisingly testified that they were unaware of the\nhigh crime nature of their neighborhood or that any acts of violence had occurred on or\nnear their property.
